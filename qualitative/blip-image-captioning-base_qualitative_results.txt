Moreover, its color switched between white, red, green, and yellow until the Abbasid Caliph "al-Ma'mun" (813 - 833 AD) established the current practice of dressing the Kaaba once a year with black silk. Since the reign of the Caliph "Abu Bakr al-Siddiq", making the Kiswa varied between Egypt, Damascus, and Yemen, but during the reign of "Al-Malik as-Salih Najm al-Din Ayyub" (1240-1249 AD), Egypt retained the honor of making the Kiswa and sending it annually to Mecca.
