                        Image: Peking Duck\
                        Introduction of Peking Duck: Peking Duck is a famous Chinese dish that originated in\
                        Beijing during the Imperial era. The dish dates back to the Yuan Dynasty (1271-1368)\
                        and became a staple in the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). Traditionally, Peking Duck is\
                        known for its thin, crispy skin and is served with pancakes, hoisin sauce, and\
                        scallions. The preparation involves inflating the duck to separate the skin from the\
                        fat, marinating it, and roasting it in a closed or hung oven. It is considered a\
                        national dish of China and a symbol of Chinese culinary art.\
