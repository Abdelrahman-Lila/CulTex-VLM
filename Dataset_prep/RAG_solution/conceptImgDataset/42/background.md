# Wikipedia: Osireion
The Osireion (or Osirion) is believed to be the cenotaph of Seti I, located to the rear of the Temple of Seti I at Abydos, Egypt. The temple was built in the 13th century BC and many researchers believe the Osireion dates from the same period.  Seti I ruled from c. 1294 BCE to c. 1279 BCE.

Layout and construction
The Osireion is part of the Temple of Seti I's complex. It may have been built to resemble the tombs in the Valley of the Kings. It is located centrally behind the main part of the Temple of Seti I along an east west axis. Most of its structure would have been subterranean. It was built at a considerably lower level than the foundations of the Temple of Seti I.  However, most of the roof has been lost. There is an entrance tunnel that runs along a north south axis behind the Osireion's central hall. It is 69 metres (226 ft) long and stone lined.
The central hall is constructed with very large stone blocks; limestone interior with sandstone facing. The roof would have been formed of large granite beams. The hall contains a stone-paved 'island' in the centre surrounded by a channel of water, the depth of which is yet to be determined. The water is at least 10.4 metres (34 ft) deep and connects to an underground water source. There are 17 small chambers in the hall's walls, and behind the wall opposite the entrance there is a 'sarcophagus chamber'.

Research
Historical accounts
Strabo visited the Osireion in the first century BCE and gave a description of the site as it appeared in his time:

 Above this city [Ptolemaïs] lies Abydus, where is the Memnonium, a royal building, which is a remarkable structure built of solid stone, and of the same workmanship as that which I ascribed to the Labyrinth, though not multiplex; and also a fountain which lies at a great depth, so that one descends to it down vaulted galleries made of monoliths of surprising size and workmanship. 
The subterranean water basin at the Osireion was consequently named "Strabo's Well" by modern excavators. Strabo then theorises that the Osireion might have been constructed by Ismandes, or Mandes, the same purported builder as with the Labyrinth at Hawara:

But if, as they say, Memnon is called Ismandes by the Egyptians, the Labyrinth might be a Memnonium, and the work of the same person who constructed those at Abydos and at Thebes; for in those places, it is said, are some Memnonia. 
Strabo's uncertainty about the origins of the structure highly suggests that these were already unknown by the time of his visit.

Rediscovery
The Osireion was rediscovered by archaeologists Flinders Petrie and Margaret Murray, who were excavating the site in 1902–1903.

Construction date
While, with regard to the depth of the building, its untypical architectural style and its mythological context, there is disagreement as to its true age.
The Egypt Exploration Society (EES) excavations uncovered an ancient mark; “Menmaatre [Seti I] is Benefical to Osiris”. It is believed to be the ancient name given to the subterranean structure. The EES came to the conclusion that it was built during the reign of Seti I, as detailed in its report published in 1933.
In his 1998 dissertation on Seti I, P.J. Brand (2000), emphasised the numerous cartouches of Seti I agreed with the EES, it "... can be dated confidently to Seti's reign".

Purpose
Since the water is connected to an underground water source, it could have been used as a well.
Graffiti by Egyptian priests of Dynasties XXI–XXII found in the long entrance passage, the vaulted galleries mentioned by Strabo, hint at its function: “The hidden / secret place of the Underworld / Duat of Menmaatre [Seti I]” and more specifically and revealing as the “Birth House of Isis”.

The Osireion is a remarkable structure located 26 feet (8 meters) behind the
temple of Seti I in Abydos, Egypt. It is believed to be Seti I’s cenotaph.
This unique monument features an underground vaulted hall with a central
platform that has 10 monolithic pillars, all surrounded by a channel of water.

Abydos itself is a prominent sacred city and an important archaeological site
of ancient Egypt. Located in the low desert west of the Nile River, it served
as a necropolis for early Egyptian royalty and later became a pilgrimage
center for the worship of Osiris. The pharaohs, who were by this time buried
near their city of residence rather than at Abydos, encouraged the cult of the
deified king at Abydos and took special care to embellish and enlarge the
temple of Osiris there.

Abydos,  prominent sacred city and one of the most important archaeological sites of ancient Egypt. The site, located in the low desert west of the Nile River near Al-Balyanā, was a necropolis for the earliest Egyptian royalty and later a pilgrimage centre for the worship of Osiris.
The western desert embayment at Abydos, Umm al-Qaʿāb, has long been known as the royal cemetery of the 1st and 2nd dynasties. Excavations underway since the late-1970s, however, revealed a group of earlier tombs belonging to a series of kings that predate the 1st dynasty and the official unification of Egypt. These tombs have yielded a rich harvest of intact pottery, royal emblems, ivory labels, and the names of several predynastic kings. The inscribed labels also indicate that Egyptian writing had reached an advanced stage earlier than was generally recognized. In addition, several large-scale mud-brick enclosures located near the desert’s edge were identified as funerary sites for the kings of the 1st (c. 2925–c. 2775 bce) and 2nd (c. 2775–c. 2650 bce) dynasties. A series of wooden boats covered by whitewashed mud-brick casings—probably prototypes for the boats buried in pits next to the pyramids of the Old Kingdom (c. 2575–c. 2130 bce)—were discovered alongside one of the enclosures.
The tutelary deity of the necropolis city in the Old Kingdom was the jackal god, called Khenti-Imentiu; in the 5th dynasty (c. 2465–c. 2325 bce), his cult was gradually absorbed by that of the god Osiris, and the city soon became the focal point of the cult of Osiris. Abydos became a place of pilgrimage for pious Egyptians, who desired above all else to be buried as close as possible to the recognized tomb of Osiris, which was located at Abydos. For those who could not afford the expense of being buried there, stelae were set up, inscribed with the dead man’s name and titles and a prayer to the god. Thousands of these stelae have been found in the city’s cemeteries.
The pharaohs, who by this time were being buried near their city of residence rather than at Abydos, encouraged the cult of the deified king at Abydos, and they took special care to embellish and enlarge the temple of Osiris there. Over the centuries the temple of Osiris was successively rebuilt or enlarged by Pepi I, Ahmose I, Thutmose III, Ramses III, and Ahmose II. Some pharaohs of the Middle and New kingdoms had a cenotaph or a mortuary temple at Abydos. The temple of Seti I was one of the most beautiful of all such temples. Its plan is unique, for it has no fewer than seven sanctuaries, approached through two broad hypostyle halls. The sanctuaries are dedicated to the pharaoh and the principal gods of Egypt. In a long gallery leading to other rooms is a relief showing Seti and his son Ramses making offerings to the cartouches of 76 of their dead predecessors, beginning with Menes. This is the so-called Abydos list of kings. The reliefs decorating the walls of this temple are of particular delicacy and beauty. Only 26 feet (8 metres) behind the temple of Seti I is a remarkable structure known as the Osireion, which is thought to be Seti’s cenotaph. This curious monument is an underground vaulted hall containing a central platform with 10 monolithic pillars surrounded by a channel of water. Another temple to Osiris, now much ruined, was built by Ramses II to the north of Seti’s temple.
Around and between the various temples of Abydos is a vast complex of cemeteries used in every period of early Egyptian history, from the prehistoric age to Roman times.
