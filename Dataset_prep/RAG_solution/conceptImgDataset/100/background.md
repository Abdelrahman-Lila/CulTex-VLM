A grotto is a natural or artificial cave that serves as a decorative feature
in gardens, particularly in 18th-century European gardens. In ancient times,
natural caves were thought to be dwelling places of divinities. Grottos were
often constructed using an assortment of rocks, shells, bones, broken glass,
and other objects, and were commonly associated with water.

Well-known garden grottoes include the Grotto of Thetis at Versailles, France;
Alexander Pope’s grotto at Twickenham, Middlesex, England; and the grotto at
Stourhead, Wiltshire, England.
