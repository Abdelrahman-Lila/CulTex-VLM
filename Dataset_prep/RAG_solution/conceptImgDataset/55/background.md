Amir Khayrbak Funerary Complex, Mosque-Madrasa of Al-Amir Khair Bak or Khayrbak Mosque (Arabic: مسجد ومدرسة الأمير خاير بك) is a religious complex at Bab al-Wazir street (Darb al-Ahmar district), Islamic Cairo, Egypt.  It originally consisted of a mausoleum established by the Ottoman governor of Egypt Khayr Bak in 1502 CE. Later he added a madrasa and a mosque, and annexed the adjacent Amir Alin Aq Palace (built in 1293) which was used by him as residence. On the surrounding area, there is Citadel of Cairo located on the southeast, Amir Alin Aq Palace on the southwest, Aqsunqur Mosque on the northeast side. It is one of many Circassian (Burji) style Mamluk architectures built during the Middle Ages.

Architecture
On the exterior there is a domed roof with floral motifs, an arched entrance covered with muqarnas, a pathway that leads to north end of the complex, and a minaret which lost its peak at the earthquake of 1884, but was reconstructed in 2003.
As for the interior, it is rectangular shaped and there is an incised bowl with four ribs, and it is surrounded by four iwans. The eastern and western iwans are deeper than the iwan with qibla which occupies the southern side of the building and the northern iwan on the opposite side, due to the building being rectangular. The walls of the iwans are surrounded by 1.5 meters marble mantle above the madrasa floor, topped with a strip inscribed with verses from Surah al-Fath. The mihrab is in the middle of the southern wall and is surrounded by two smaller rings. These three girders occupy the whole area of the southern iwan.

The Khayrbak Mosque is a historical mosque located in Cairo, Egypt. It is part
of a larger complex that includes a mausoleum and a sabil-kuttab (a public
water fountain with a school above it). The mosque is situated in the Darb al-
Ahmar district, an area known for its rich Islamic heritage and numerous
historical buildings.

The complex was built in the early 16th century during the Mamluk period,
commissioned by Emir Khayrbak, who was a prominent figure in the Mamluk
Sultanate. Khayrbak initially served as the governor of Aleppo before becoming
a key supporter of the Ottoman Empire's conquest of Egypt. As a reward for his
loyalty, he was appointed as the first Ottoman governor of Egypt.

The architecture of the Khayrbak Mosque reflects the transition from Mamluk to
Ottoman styles, characterized by intricate stonework, decorative motifs, and a
blend of traditional Islamic architectural elements. The mosque's minaret and
dome are notable features, showcasing the artistic and architectural skills of
the period.

The Khayrbak Mosque complex has undergone restoration efforts to preserve its
historical and architectural significance. It remains an important site for
understanding the cultural and historical context of Cairo during the Mamluk
and early Ottoman periods. Visitors to the mosque can appreciate its
architectural beauty and its role in the rich tapestry of Cairo's Islamic
heritage.
