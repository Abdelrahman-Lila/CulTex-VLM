# Wikipedia: Pyramid of Ahmose
The pyramid of Ahmose is a pyramid erected in the reign of the Ancient Egyptian king Ahmose I, ca. 1550-1525 BC, at Abydos in Upper Egypt. It was the last royal pyramid to be built in Egypt, since Ahmose I's successors also decided not to be interred in pyramids, and is the only royal pyramid to have been built from the beginning as a cenotaph rather than an actual tomb. 
The pyramid is now totally ruined and appears like a shallow hill, about 10 metres in height. It forms part of an unusual complex, consisting of a valley temple near the River Nile, at least four temples around the pyramid itself, and to the south of the pyramid another pyramid for the king's grandmother Tetisheri, a symbolic tomb of Osiris, and a terrace temple. The complex was excavated between 1899 and 1904 and further excavations have been ongoing since 1993.

Research
The complex was first investigated and identified as a pyramid by Arthur Mace and Charles T. Currelly between 1899 and 1902 on behalf of the Egypt Exploration Fund. Their work was partial and gave only a rough overview of the structure. The excavations focussed on the pyramid temple. Mace also dug a tunnel under the pyramid, in order to locate a hypothesised lower chamber. Currelly carried out further work in the area until 1904.
Since 1993, new excavations have been undertaken on the complex by Stephen P. Harvey, which have identified numerous relief fragments and made clear that the Tetisheri-chapel is a pyramid. In these excavations many structures outside the temple complex have also been uncovered.

Context
After his victory over the Hyksos, who had ruled Egypt for more than a hundred years, Ahmose I exercised full sovereignty over the whole country (Upper and Lower Egypt) and this marked the beginning of the New Kingdom. Ahmose's grandmother, Tetisheri, seems to have been a driving force in the efforts to reunify the country.
Although Abydos had been a significant location for religious buildings and tombs since prehistoric times, Ahmose's pyramid was the first large pyramid to be built there. Various rulers of the preceding 17th Dynasty had had tombs there in the form of small pyramids, which did not measure more than 10 metres in length. The layout of Ahmose's pyramid and temple complex differed fundamentally from all earlier pyramid complexes, since the typical schema of Valley Temple, Causeway, Pyramid Temple and Pyramid was not followed. Instead, new elements were introduced to the complex: the Terrace Temple and the Grave of Osiris. 
The pyramid was a cenotaph; the actual grave of Ahmose, whose location was long unknown, was probably located in Dra' Abu el-Naga'. It might be the small pyramid discovered by Herbert E. Winlock in 1913, but some scholars have ascribed this tomb to Ahmose's predecessor Kamose or his possible son Ahmose Sapair. The mummies of Ahmose and Tetisheri were found in the Royal Cache at Deir el-Bahari, where they were brought in the 22nd Dynasty to protect them from grave robbers.
The cult of Ahmose in the Pyramid and its temple complex is known from a stele inscribed about three hundred years later in the reign of Ramesses II. The inscription records that a processional boat of the cult of Ahmose was used by the locals as an oracle of the deified king.

Pyramid
The pyramid measured 52.5 m (172 ft) on each side, which corresponds to 100 royal cubits, and consisted of a core of rubble and sand, which was hidden with a cladding of fine limestone. This core was given form by the cladding and had no structural support of its own. In his excavations, Mace found cladding stones still in situ in two spots, from which he was able to calculate the slope of the pyramid as 60Â°, making it substantially steeper than the pyramids of the Old and Middle Kingdoms. Based on this slope, the pyramid would have been 45 metres tall.
After the cladding was spoliated in later times, the core lost its coherence and spread out, becoming the ten-meter-high rubble mound that exists today. The core material might have derived from excavation of the underground Grave of Osiris in the southern part of the complex.
A crescent-shaped structure of mud brick between the north side of the pyramid and the pyramid temple was identified by Harvey as the remains of a construction ramp.
The pyramid is the only one of the large Egyptian pyramids which has no substructure, which indicates that it did not serve as an actual tomb. In 1902, Mace dug a tunnel under the ruins from the north side, searching in vain for a buried entrance tunnel. Later excavations were also unable to find any substructure beneath the pyramid. The existence of chambers within the superstructure of the pyramid can be ruled out because of the looseness of the rubble and sand core.

Complex
The pyramid complex has a unique layout that was not used for any previous pyramid. The normal complex consisted of a valley temple in the vegetation zone of the valley and another temple in the desert next to the pyramid. Instead, the pyramid of Ahmose had the valley temple near the floodplain of the Nile. Moreover, in the desert, the pyramid was surrounded by multiple temples instead of just one and, beyond the temple further into the desert, there was a tomb of Osiris and a terrace temple. The stretched-out layout recalls the tomb of Osiris which Sesostris III had built at Abydos. The components are precisely aligned and were probably linked by a straight road, although this is no longer detectable. Unlike earlier pyramid complexes, there is no sign of a precinct wall.

Pyramid temples
The pyramid temple was located on the north side of the pyramid but was not directly attached to it. The structure has thick walls and accessway, leading to a central courtyard. At the back of this, there was a colonnade. Near the entrance there were two holes which might have contained trees.  Harvey found over 2000 painted relief fragments in the temple area, which depict Ahmose fighting the Hyksos and once decorated the temple. These reliefs include the oldest known depictions of horses with war chariots in Egypt. 
Another smaller temple (Temple A) was located at the northeast corner of the pyramid and was dedicated to Ahmose and his sister-wife Ahmose-Nefertari. This structure was falsely identified by earlier scholars as a cult pyramid on account of its location. Directly to the east of Temple A are the remains of another temple (Temple B), which was dedicated to Ahmose. A larger temple (Temple C) was located to the north of it, next to the main pyramid temple. It was dedicated to Ahmose Nefertari.
To the east, are the ruins of a building for provisioning or administration. However, the eastern part of the complex is now the site of a modern cemetery, so it is not accessible to researchers.

Pyramid of Tetisheri
Halfway between the pyramid of Ahmose and the terrace temple are the remains of a brick structure, measuring 21 metres by 23 metres, which was originally identified as a shrine of Ahmose's grandmother Tetisheri on the basis of an inscription found there. In 1902 another stele (CG 34002) was found in the ruins, which refers to the pyramid and temple of Tetisheri. In this inscription, Ahmose tells his wife about his plans to erect a pyramid as a memorial for Tetisheri, who was buried in Thebes.

"I am blessed, who remember the mother of my mother and the mother of my father, the great royal wife and queen mother, Tetisheri. She has her funerary chapel still in the earth of Thebes and Abydos. My Majesty wishes, that a pyramid and a funerary temple be erected for her near my memorial in the sublime land." The lake of the funerary temple was dug, the trees planted, and the offerings gathered, and it was provided with estates and herds.

When this stele was found, it was supposed that the reference to a pyramid was only symbolic, since the ruins were not recognised as a pyramid structure. The gardens and artificial lake mentioned by the inscription have not been detected archaeologically.
Newer work by Harvey proves that the structure was an actual pyramid. Unusually, it was erected on a foundation of brick casemates filled with rubble. An entranceway ran between these casemates to the centre of the pyramid. Excavations revealed fragments of the pyramidion, which indicates that the angle of inclination was similar to that of Ahmose's pyramid. The discovery confirmed that the inscribed stele was referring to a literal pyramid. Traces of a mud-brick enclosure wall around the pyramid, measuring 90 x 70 metres, were also detected. There are traces of several small buildings inside this enclosure, but their purpose is not known.

Tomb of Osiris
In the southern part of the complex was a Tomb of Osiris. This was a symbolic grave of the dead god Osiris, whose body had been scattered across the whole land according to the Osiris myth. It could also be seen as a symbolic version of the underworld.
The tomb of Osiris is similar to that of Sesostris III, but very roughly built. The entrance hole was not very visible and did not differ from the entrance to the grave of an ordinary Egyptian. The underground entranceway was roughly cut from the rock. Shortly after the entrance were two small side chambers. Midway along the passage there was a hall with 18 pillars cut from the rock, which has the same height as the passageway. Beyond the hall, the passageway descended further until it reached a simple grotto. The walls of the chambers and the passageway were not plastered or decorated. The tomb is located on the orientation line running from the pyramid to the terrace temple, like the other buildings of the complex.

Terrace temple
At the south end of the complex, was a terrace temple, located at the base of a cliff. Votive offerings in the form of ceramic vessels, models of boats, and stone vases were found here. The temple was reached by climbing up several staircases and trapezoid rooms. Above this, a corridor led south to a small chamber, where there was probably a statue of the ruler standing on a podium.

Significance
The pyramid of Ahmose was the last royal pyramid to be erected in Egypt. While the resumption of pyramid building in the Middle Kingdom had led to the erection of a series of pyramids, this would be the only pyramid built in the new kingdom and none of Ahmose's successors seem to have attempted to build a pyramid. However, private graves in the New Kingdom were often topped with small pyramidal structures. Much later, the Nubian kings who ruled over Egypt as the 25th Dynasty, built Nubian pyramids for themselves, but these were located outside the traditional area of Egypt.

### About Ahmose

Ahmose I (reigned c. 1539â1515 BCE) was an ancient Egyptian king and founder
of the 18th dynasty. He is known for completing the expulsion of the Hyksos,
Asiatic rulers of Egypt, and re-exerting Egyptâs control over northern Nubia.
Ahmose I resumed the war to liberate Egypt from the Hyksos, crushing their
allies and capturing Memphis. He then launched a waterborne operation against
Avaris, the Hyksos capital, followed by a land siege. After quelling a
rebellion in Upper Egypt, he captured Avaris and pursued the enemy to Sharuhen
in Palestine, which he seized

Ahmose I,  was king of ancient Egypt (reigned c. 1539â15 bce) and founder of the 18th dynasty who completed the expulsion of the Hyksos (Asiatic rulers of Egypt), invaded Palestine, and re-exerted Egyptâs hegemony over northern Nubia, to the south.
Resuming the war of liberation against the Hyksos early in his reign, Ahmose crushed the foreignersâ allies in Middle Egypt and, advancing down the Nile River, captured Memphis, the traditional capital of Egypt, near present-day Cairo. While his mother, Queen Ahhotep, acted as his representative in Thebes (partially occupied by modern Luxor), he undertook a waterborne operation against Avaris, the Hyksos capital, in the eastern delta, followed by a land siege. When a rebellion flared in Upper Egypt, he hastened upriver to quell the rising, while Ahhotep helped to contain it. Having put down the rising, he captured Avaris and then pursued the enemy to Sharuhen, a Hyksos stronghold in Palestine, which was reduced after a three-year siege.
Before advancing into Palestine, Ahmose in three campaigns advanced into Nubia, whose ruler had been an ally of the Hyksos. The rich gold mines of the south provided another incentive for Ahmoseâs expansion into Nubia.
After his borders were secure, Ahmose established an administration loyal to him in Egypt and granted lands to distinguished veterans of his campaigns and to members of the royal family. He reactivated the copper mines at Sinai and resumed trade with the cities of the Syrian coast, as attested by inscriptions recording the use of cedar found in Syria and by the rich jewelry from his reign. He restored neglected temples and erected chapels for his family at Abydos, and he died soon afterward, leaving a prosperous and reunited Egypt.

## Britannica: Step Pyramid of Djoser |Description, Theories, & Facts | Britannica
Step Pyramid of Djoser,  the oldest important stone building in Egypt, the centre of a large mortuary complex in the á¹¢aqqÄrah necropolis. Little is known about the kings of Egypt in the Old Kingdom period, but the pyramids they created were massively impressive statements of their power and wealth, as well as of their immortality. The first of them was this step pyramid, designed for Djoser, first king of the 3rd dynasty, by the worldâs first named architect, Imhotep, who is also a key figure in the history of medicine. Imhotep designed the pyramid around the 26th century BCE.
Constructed at a location in the desert outside Djoserâs capital city of Memphis, from where it could be seen dominating the skyline, the pyramid was a translation of earlier Egyptian architecture into stone. Its diminishing six-tier âstepâ layers of stone and clay rose to a height of about 200 feet (61 m) and were originally covered in gleaming white limestone. The four faces of the pyramidâs square base were generally oriented to the cardinal points. There were numerous gates, but the one true entrance was between columns and led through to the central courtyard.
It is believed that the pyramid held statues of the Egyptian gods and of Djoser himself and members of his family, including a life-sized sculpture of him seated on his throne. Beneath the pyramid was an underground structure of unprecedented size and complexity, with galleries and some 400 rooms.
The pyramid stood in a complex of buildings, some of which were apparently dummies, perhaps meant for the kingâs spirit for a time after death or connected with his jubilee ceremonies. On the south side was the marked-out course that each pharaoh would run around during Heb-Sed ceremony at his coronation. There were also tombs for other members of the ruling house. The wall around the complex was more than 1 mile (1.6 km) long and originally 34 feet (11 m) high. The whole site has been described as âa vast city of the dead.â

## Britannica: Pyramids of Giza | History, Location, Age, Interior, & Facts | Britannica
Pyramids of Giza,  three 4th-dynasty (c. 2575âc. 2465 bce) pyramids erected on a rocky plateau on the west bank of the Nile River near Al-JÄ«zah (Giza) in northern Egypt. In ancient times they were included among the Seven Wonders of the World. The ancient ruins of the Memphis area, including the Pyramids of Giza, á¹¢aqqÄrah, DahshÅ«r, AbÅ« Ruwaysh, and AbÅ« á¹¢Ä«r, were collectively designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979.
The designations of the pyramidsâKhufu, Khafre, and Menkaureâcorrespond to the kings for whom they were built. The northernmost and oldest pyramid of the group was built for Khufu (Greek: Cheops), the second king of the 4th dynasty. Called the Great Pyramid, it is the largest of the three, the length of each side at the base averaging 755.75 feet (230 meters) and its original height being 481.4 feet (147 meters). The middle pyramid was built for Khafre (Greek: Chephren), the fourth of the eight kings of the 4th dynasty; the structure measures 707.75 feet (216 meters) on each side and was originally 471 feet (143 meters) high. The southernmost and last pyramid to be built was that of Menkaure (Greek: Mykerinus), the fifth king of the 4th dynasty; each side measures 356.5 feet (109 meters), and the structureâs completed height was 218 feet (66 meters). All three pyramids were plundered both internally and externally in ancient and medieval times. Thus, the grave goods originally deposited in the burial chambers are missing, and the pyramids no longer reach their original heights because they have been almost entirely stripped of their outer casings of smooth white limestone; the Great Pyramid, for example, is now only 451.4 feet (138 meters) high. That of Khafre retains the outer limestone casing only at its topmost portion. Constructed near each pyramid was a mortuary temple, which was linked via a sloping causeway to a valley temple on the edge of the Nile floodplain. Also nearby were subsidiary pyramids used for the burials of other members of the royal family.
Khufuâs pyramid is perhaps the most colossal single building ever erected on the planet. Its sides rise at an angle of 51Â°52â² and are accurately oriented to the four cardinal points of the compass. The Great Pyramidâs core is made of yellowish limestone blocks, the outer casing (now almost completely gone) and the inner passages are of finer light-colored limestone, and the interior burial chamber is built of huge blocks of granite. Approximately 2.3 million blocks of stone were cut, transported, and assembled to create the 5.75-million-ton structure, which is a masterpiece of technical skill and engineering ability. The internal walls as well as those few outer-casing stones that still remain in place show finer joints than any other masonry constructed in ancient Egypt.
The entrance to the Great Pyramid is on the north side, about 59 feet (18 meters) above ground level. A sloping corridor descends from it through the pyramidâs interior masonry, penetrates the rocky soil on which the structure rests, and ends in an unfinished underground chamber. From the descending corridor branches an ascending passageway that leads to a room known as the Queenâs Chamber and to a great slanting gallery that is 151 feet (46 meters) long. At the upper end of this gallery, a long and narrow passage gives access to the burial room proper, usually termed the Kingâs Chamber. This room is entirely lined and roofed with granite. From the chamber two narrow shafts run obliquely through the masonry to the exterior of the pyramid; it is not known whether they were designed for a religious purpose or were meant for ventilation. Above the Kingâs Chamber are five compartments separated by massive horizontal granite slabs; the likely purpose of these slabs was to shield the ceiling of the burial chamber by diverting the immense thrust exerted by the overlying masses of masonry.
The question of how the pyramids were built has not received a wholly satisfactory answer. The most plausible one is that the Egyptians employed a sloping and encircling embankment of brick, earth, and sand, which was increased in height and in length as the pyramid rose; stone blocks were hauled up the ramp by means of sledges, rollers, and levers. According to the ancient Greek historian Herodotus, the Great Pyramid took 20 years to construct and demanded the labor of 100,000 men. This figure is believable given the assumption that these men, who were agricultural laborers, worked on the pyramids only (or primarily) while there was little work to be done in the fieldsâi.e., when the Nile River was in flood. By the late 20th century, however, archaeologists found evidence that a more limited workforce may have occupied the site on a permanent rather than a seasonal basis. It was suggested that as few as 20,000 workers, with accompanying support personnel (bakers, physicians, priests, etc.), would have been adequate for the task.
To the south of the Great Pyramid near Khafreâs valley temple lies the Great Sphinx. Carved out of limestone, the Sphinx has the facial features of a man but the body of a recumbent lion; it is approximately 240 feet (73 meters) long and 66 feet (20 meters) high. (See sphinx.)
In 1925 a pit tomb containing the transferred burial equipment of Khufuâs mother, Queen Hetepheres, was discovered near the upper end of the causeway of Khufu. At the bottom of a deep stone-filled shaft was found the queenâs empty sarcophagus, surrounded by furniture and articles of jewelry attesting to the high artistic ability and technical perfection of the 4th-dynasty craftsmen.
Surrounding the three pyramids are extensive fields of flat-topped funerary structures called mastabas; arranged in a grid pattern, the mastabas were used for the burials of relatives or officials of the kings. Besides the core mastabas of the 4th dynasty, numerous mastabas from the 5th and 6th dynasties (c. 2465âc. 2150 bce) have been found around and among the earlier structures.
In the late 1980s and â90s, excavations in the environs of the pyramids revealed laborersâ districts that included bakeries, storage areas, workshops, and the small tombs of workers and artisans. Mud sealings seem to date the workshop areas to the late 4th dynasty. The tombs range from simple mud-brick domes to more-elaborate stone monuments. Statuettes were found within some of the structures; hieroglyphic inscriptions on tomb walls occasionally identify the deceased.

## Britannica: Ancient Egypt - Pharaohs, Pyramids, Temples | Britannica
Although Ahmose (ruled c. 1539â15 bce) had been preceded by Kamose, who was either his father or his brother, Egyptian tradition regarded Ahmose as the founder of a new dynasty because he was the native ruler who reunified Egypt. Continuing a recently inaugurated practice, he married his full sister Ahmose-Nofretari. The queen was given the title of Godâs Wife of Amon. Like her predecessors of the 17th dynasty, Queen Ahmose-Nofretari was influential and highly honored. A measure of her importance was her posthumous veneration at Thebes, where later pharaohs were depicted offering to her as a goddess among the gods.
Ahmoseâs campaigns to expel the Hyksos from the Nile River delta and regain former Egyptian territory to the south probably started around his 10th regnal year. Destroying the Hyksos stronghold at Avaris, in the eastern delta, he finally drove them beyond the eastern frontier and then besieged Sharuá¸¥en (Tell al-FÄrÊ¿ah) in southern Palestine; the full extent of his conquests may have been much greater. His penetration of the Middle East came at a time when there was no major established power in the region. This political gap facilitated the creation of an Egyptian âempire.â
Ahmoseâs officers and soldiers were rewarded with spoil and captives, who were enslaved as personal servants. This marked the creation of an influential military class. Like Kamose, Ahmose campaigned as far south as Buhen. For the administration of the regained territory, he created a new office, overseer of southern foreign lands, which ranked second only to the vizier. Its incumbent was accorded the honorific title of kingâs son, indicating that he was directly responsible to the king as deputy.
The early New Kingdom bureaucracy was modeled on that of the Middle Kingdom. The vizier was the chief administrator and the highest judge of the realm. By the mid-15th century bce the office had been divided into two, one vizier for Upper and one for Lower Egypt. During the 18th dynasty some young bureaucrats were educated in temple schools, reinforcing the integration of civil and priestly sectors. Early in the dynasty many administrative posts were inherited, but royal appointment of capable officials, often selected from military officers who had served the king on his campaigns, later became the rule. The trend was thus away from bureaucratic families and the inheritance of office.
Ahmoseâs son and successor, Amenhotep I (ruled c. 1514âc. 1494 bce), pushed the Egyptian frontier southward to the Third Cataract, near the capital of the Karmah (Kerma) state, while also gathering tribute from his Asiatic possessions and perhaps campaigning in Syria. The emerging kingdom of Mitanni in northern Syria, which is first mentioned on a stela of one of Amenhotepâs soldiers and was also known by the name of Nahrin, may have threatened Egyptâs conquests to the north.
The New Kingdom was a time of increased devotion to the state god Amon-Re, whose cult largely benefited as Egypt was enriched by the spoils of war. Riches were turned over to the godâs treasuries, and as a sign of filial piety the king had sacred monuments constructed at Thebes. Under Amenhotep I the pyramidal form of royal tomb was abandoned in favor of a rock-cut tomb, and, except for Akhenaton, all subsequent New Kingdom rulers were buried in concealed tombs in the famous Valley of the Kings in western Thebes. Separated from the tombs, royal mortuary temples were erected at the edge of the desert. Perhaps because of this innovation, Amenhotep I later became the patron deity of the workmen who excavated and decorated the royal tombs. The location of his own tomb is unknown.
Lacking a surviving heir, Amenhotep I was succeeded by one of his generals, Thutmose I (ruled c. 1493âc. 1483 bce), who married his own full sister Ahmose. In the south Thutmose destroyed the Karmah state. He inscribed a rock as a boundary marker, later confirmed by Thutmose III, near Kanisa-Kurgus, north of the Fifth Cataract. He then executed a brilliant campaign into Syria and across the Euphrates River, where he erected a victory stela near Carchemish.
Thus, in the reign of Thutmose I, Egyptian conquests in the Middle East and Africa reached their greatest extent, but they may not yet have been firmly held. His little-known successor, Thutmose II (c. 1482â80 bce), apparently continued his policies.
At Thutmose IIâs death his queen and sister, Hatshepsut, had only a young daughter; but a minor wife had borne him a boy, who was apparently very young at his accession. This son, Thutmose III (ruled c. 1479â25 bce), later reconquered Egyptâs Asian empire and became an outstanding ruler. During his first few regnal years, Thutmose III theoretically controlled the land, but Hatshepsut governed as regent. Sometime between Thutmose IIIâs second and seventh regnal years, she assumed the kingship herself. According to one version of the event, the oracle of Amon proclaimed her king at Karnak, where she was crowned. A more propagandistic account, preserved in texts and reliefs of her splendid mortuary temple at Dayr al-Baá¸¥rÄ«, ignores the reign of Thutmose II and asserts that her father, Thutmose I, proclaimed her his successor. Upon becoming king, Hatshepsut became the dominant partner in a joint rule that lasted until her death in about 1458 bce; there are monuments dedicated by Hatshepsut that depict both kings. She had the support of various powerful personalities; the most notable among them was Senenmut, the steward and tutor of her daughter Neferure. In styling herself king, Hatshepsut adopted the royal titulary but avoided the epithet âmighty bull,â regularly employed by other kings. Although in her reliefs she was depicted as a male, pronominal references in the texts usually reflect her womanhood. Similarly, much of her statuary shows her in male form, but there are rarer examples that render her as a woman. In less formal documents she was referred to as âKingâs Great Wifeââthat is, âQueenââwhile Thutmose III was âKing.â There is thus a certain ambiguity in the treatment of Hatshepsut as king.
Her temple reliefs depict pacific enterprises, such as the transporting of obelisks for Amonâs temple and a commercial expedition to Punt; her art style looked back to Middle Kingdom ideals. Some warlike scenes are depicted, however, and she may have waged a campaign in Nubia. In one inscription she blamed the Hyksos for the supposedly poor state of the land before her rule, even though they had been expelled from the region more than a generation earlier.
During Hatshepsutâs ascendancy Egyptâs position in Asia may have deteriorated because of the expansion of Mitannian power in Syria. Shortly after her death, the prince of the Syrian city of Kadesh, stood with troops of 330 princes of a Syro-Palestinian coalition at Megiddo; such a force was more than merely defensive, and the intention may have been to advance against Egypt. The 330 must have represented all the places of any size in the region that were not subject to Egyptian rule and may be a schematic figure derived from a list of place-names. It is noteworthy that Mitanni itself was not directly involved.
Thutmose III proceeded to Gaza with his army and then to Yehem, subjugating rebellious Palestinian towns along the way. His annals relate how, at a consultation concerning the best route over the Mount Carmel ridge, the king overruled his officers and selected a shorter but more dangerous route through the Ê¿ArÅ«nah Pass and then led the troops himself. The march went smoothly, and, when the Egyptians attacked at dawn, they prevailed over the enemy troops and besieged Megiddo.
Thutmose III meanwhile coordinated the landing of other army divisions on the Syro-Palestinian littoral, whence they proceeded inland, so that the strategy resembled a pincer technique. The siege ended in a treaty by which Syrian princes swore an oath of submission to the king. As was normal in ancient diplomacy and in Egyptian practice, the oath was binding only upon those who swore it, not upon future generations.
By the end of the first campaign, Egyptian domination extended northward to a line linking Byblos and Damascus. Although the prince of Kadesh remained to be vanquished, Assyria sent lapis lazuli as tribute; Asian princes surrendered their weapons, including a large number of horses and chariots. Thutmose III took only a limited number of captives. He appointed Asian princes to govern the towns and took their brothers and sons to Egypt, where they were educated at the court. Most eventually returned home to serve as loyal vassals, though some remained in Egypt at court. In order to ensure the loyalty of Asian city-states, Egypt maintained garrisons that could quell insurrection and supervise the delivery of tribute. There never was an elaborate Egyptian imperial administration in Asia.
Thutmose III conducted numerous subsequent campaigns in Asia. The submission of Kadesh was finally achieved, but Thutmose IIIâs ultimate aim was the defeat of Mitanni. He used the navy to transport troops to Asian coastal towns, avoiding arduous overland marches from Egypt. His great eighth campaign led him across the Euphrates; although the countryside around Carchemish was ravaged, the city was not taken, and the Mitannian prince was able to flee. The psychological gain of this campaign was perhaps greater than its military success, for Babylonia, Assyria, and the Hittites all sent tribute in recognition of Egyptian dominance. Although Thutmose III never subjugated Mitanni, he placed Egyptâs conquests on a firm footing by constant campaigning that contrasts with the forays of his predecessors. Thutmose IIIâs annals inscribed in the temple of Karnak are remarkably succinct and accurate, but his other texts, particularly one set in his newly founded Nubian capital of Napata, are more conventional in their rhetoric. He seems to have married three Syrian wives, which may represent diplomatic unions, marking Egyptâs entry into the realm of international affairs of the ancient Middle East.
Thutmose III initiated a truly imperial Egyptian rule in Nubia. Much of the land became estates of institutions in Egypt, while local cultural traits disappear from the archaeological record. Sons of chiefs were educated at the Egyptian court; a few returned to Nubia to serve as administrators, and some were buried there in Egyptian fashion. Nubian fortresses lost their strategic value and became administrative centers. Open towns developed around them, and, in several temples outside their walls, the cult of the divine king was established. Lower Nubia supplied gold from the desert and hard and semiprecious stones. From farther south came tropical African woods, perfumes, oil, ivory, animal skins, and ostrich plumes. There is scarcely any trace of local population from the later New Kingdom, when many more temples were built in Nubia; by the end of the 20th dynasty, the region had almost no prosperous settled population.
Under Thutmose III the wealth of empire became apparent in Egypt. Many temples were built, and vast sums were donated to the estate of Amon-Re. There are many tombs of his high officials at Thebes. The capital had been moved to Memphis, but Thebes remained the religious center.
The campaigns of kings such as Thutmose III required a large military establishment, including a hierarchy of officers and an expensive chariotry. The king grew up with military companions whose close connection with him enabled them to participate increasingly in government. Military officers were appointed to high civil and religious positions, and by the Ramesside period the influence of such people had come to outweigh that of the traditional bureaucracy.
About two years before his death, Thutmose III appointed his 18-year-old son, Amenhotep II (ruled c. 1425âc. 1400 bce), as coregent. Just prior to his fatherâs death, Amenhotep II set out on a campaign to an area in Syria near Kadesh, whose city-states were now caught up in the power struggle between Egypt and Mitanni; Amenhotep II killed seven princes and shipped their bodies back to Egypt to be suspended from the ramparts of Thebes and Napata. In his seventh and ninth years, Amenhotep II made further campaigns into Asia, where the Mitannian king pursued a more vigorous policy. The revolt of the important coastal city of Ugarit was a serious matter, because Egyptian control over Syria required bases along the littoral for inland operations and the provisioning of the army. Ugarit was pacified, and the fealty of Syrian cities, including Kadesh, was reconfirmed.

The two principal building materials used in ancient Egypt were unbaked mud brick and stone. From the Old Kingdom onward stone was generally used for tombsâthe eternal dwellings of the deadâand for templesâthe eternal houses of the gods. Mud brick remained the domestic material, used even for royal palaces; it was also used for fortresses, the great walls of temple precincts and towns, and for subsidiary buildings in temple complexes.
Most ancient Egyptian towns have been lost because they were situated in the cultivated and flooded area of the Nile Valley; many temples and tombs have survived because they were built on ground unaffected by the Nile flood. Any survey of Egyptian architecture will in consequence be weighted in favor of funerary and religious buildings. Yet the dry, hot climate of Egypt has allowed some mud brick structures to survive where they have escaped the destructive effects of water or man.
Mortuary architecture in Egypt was highly developed and often grandiose. The tomb was a place in which a corpse might be protected from desecration and be provided with material objects to ensure continued existence after death. Part of the tomb might be decorated with scenes that would enable the individual to pursue magically an afterlife suitable and similar to his or her worldly existence. For a king the expectations were quite different; for him the tomb became the vehicle whereby he might achieve his exclusive destiny with the gods in a celestial afterlife.
Most tombs comprised two principal parts, the burial chamber (the tomb proper) and the chapel, in which offerings for the deceased could be made. In royal burials the chapel rapidly developed into a mortuary temple, which beginning in the New Kingdom was usually built separately and at some distance from the tomb. In the following discussion, funerary temples built separately will be discussed with temples in general and not as part of the funerary complex.
In the earliest dynasties the tombs of kings and high officials were made of mud brick and of such similar size that it is difficult to distinguish between them. The tombs at Abydos are royal, whereas those at á¹¢aqqÄrah are noble. The latter, better preserved than the former, reveal rectangular superstructures, called mastabas (see below), with sides constructed in the form of paneled niches painted white and decorated with elaborate âmattingâ designs.
These great superstructures were constructed over many storage chambers stocked with food and equipment for the deceased, who lay in a rectangular burial chamber below ground. Also within the superstructure, but not always clearly evident, was a low mound of earth, possibly representing the grave of earlier times.
The Step Pyramid of Djoser, second king of the 3rd dynasty, was built within a vast enclosure on a commanding site at á¹¢aqqÄrah, overlooking the city of Memphis. A high royal official, Imhotep, has traditionally been credited with the design and with the decision to use quarried stone. This first essay in stone is remarkable for its design of six superposed stages of diminishing size, and also for its huge enclosure (1,784 by 909 feet [544 by 277 meters]) surrounded by a paneled wall faced with fine limestone and containing a series of âmockâ buildings that probably represent structures associated with the heraldic shrines of Upper and Lower Egypt. There the Egyptian stonemasons made their earliest architectural innovations, using stone to reproduce the forms of early wood and brick buildings. Fine reliefs of the king and elaborate wall panels in glazed tiles in parts of the subterranean complexes are among the innovations found in this remarkable monument.

Although Ahmose (ruled c. 1539â15 bce) had been preceded by Kamose, who was either his father or his brother, Egyptian tradition regarded Ahmose as the founder of a new dynasty because he was the native ruler who reunified Egypt. Continuing a recently inaugurated practice, he married his full sister Ahmose-Nofretari. The queen was given the title of Godâs Wife of Amon. Like her predecessors of the 17th dynasty, Queen Ahmose-Nofretari was influential and highly honored. A measure of her importance was her posthumous veneration at Thebes, where later pharaohs were depicted offering to her as a goddess among the gods.
Ahmoseâs campaigns to expel the Hyksos from the Nile River delta and regain former Egyptian territory to the south probably started around his 10th regnal year. Destroying the Hyksos stronghold at Avaris, in the eastern delta, he finally drove them beyond the eastern frontier and then besieged Sharuá¸¥en (Tell al-FÄrÊ¿ah) in southern Palestine; the full extent of his conquests may have been much greater. His penetration of the Middle East came at a time when there was no major established power in the region. This political gap facilitated the creation of an Egyptian âempire.â
Ahmoseâs officers and soldiers were rewarded with spoil and captives, who were enslaved as personal servants. This marked the creation of an influential military class. Like Kamose, Ahmose campaigned as far south as Buhen. For the administration of the regained territory, he created a new office, overseer of southern foreign lands, which ranked second only to the vizier. Its incumbent was accorded the honorific title of kingâs son, indicating that he was directly responsible to the king as deputy.
The early New Kingdom bureaucracy was modeled on that of the Middle Kingdom. The vizier was the chief administrator and the highest judge of the realm. By the mid-15th century bce the office had been divided into two, one vizier for Upper and one for Lower Egypt. During the 18th dynasty some young bureaucrats were educated in temple schools, reinforcing the integration of civil and priestly sectors. Early in the dynasty many administrative posts were inherited, but royal appointment of capable officials, often selected from military officers who had served the king on his campaigns, later became the rule. The trend was thus away from bureaucratic families and the inheritance of office.
Ahmoseâs son and successor, Amenhotep I (ruled c. 1514âc. 1494 bce), pushed the Egyptian frontier southward to the Third Cataract, near the capital of the Karmah (Kerma) state, while also gathering tribute from his Asiatic possessions and perhaps campaigning in Syria. The emerging kingdom of Mitanni in northern Syria, which is first mentioned on a stela of one of Amenhotepâs soldiers and was also known by the name of Nahrin, may have threatened Egyptâs conquests to the north.
The New Kingdom was a time of increased devotion to the state god Amon-Re, whose cult largely benefited as Egypt was enriched by the spoils of war. Riches were turned over to the godâs treasuries, and as a sign of filial piety the king had sacred monuments constructed at Thebes. Under Amenhotep I the pyramidal form of royal tomb was abandoned in favor of a rock-cut tomb, and, except for Akhenaton, all subsequent New Kingdom rulers were buried in concealed tombs in the famous Valley of the Kings in western Thebes. Separated from the tombs, royal mortuary temples were erected at the edge of the desert. Perhaps because of this innovation, Amenhotep I later became the patron deity of the workmen who excavated and decorated the royal tombs. The location of his own tomb is unknown.
Lacking a surviving heir, Amenhotep I was succeeded by one of his generals, Thutmose I (ruled c. 1493âc. 1483 bce), who married his own full sister Ahmose. In the south Thutmose destroyed the Karmah state. He inscribed a rock as a boundary marker, later confirmed by Thutmose III, near Kanisa-Kurgus, north of the Fifth Cataract. He then executed a brilliant campaign into Syria and across the Euphrates River, where he erected a victory stela near Carchemish.
Thus, in the reign of Thutmose I, Egyptian conquests in the Middle East and Africa reached their greatest extent, but they may not yet have been firmly held. His little-known successor, Thutmose II (c. 1482â80 bce), apparently continued his policies.
At Thutmose IIâs death his queen and sister, Hatshepsut, had only a young daughter; but a minor wife had borne him a boy, who was apparently very young at his accession. This son, Thutmose III (ruled c. 1479â25 bce), later reconquered Egyptâs Asian empire and became an outstanding ruler. During his first few regnal years, Thutmose III theoretically controlled the land, but Hatshepsut governed as regent. Sometime between Thutmose IIIâs second and seventh regnal years, she assumed the kingship herself. According to one version of the event, the oracle of Amon proclaimed her king at Karnak, where she was crowned. A more propagandistic account, preserved in texts and reliefs of her splendid mortuary temple at Dayr al-Baá¸¥rÄ«, ignores the reign of Thutmose II and asserts that her father, Thutmose I, proclaimed her his successor. Upon becoming king, Hatshepsut became the dominant partner in a joint rule that lasted until her death in about 1458 bce; there are monuments dedicated by Hatshepsut that depict both kings. She had the support of various powerful personalities; the most notable among them was Senenmut, the steward and tutor of her daughter Neferure. In styling herself king, Hatshepsut adopted the royal titulary but avoided the epithet âmighty bull,â regularly employed by other kings. Although in her reliefs she was depicted as a male, pronominal references in the texts usually reflect her womanhood. Similarly, much of her statuary shows her in male form, but there are rarer examples that render her as a woman. In less formal documents she was referred to as âKingâs Great Wifeââthat is, âQueenââwhile Thutmose III was âKing.â There is thus a certain ambiguity in the treatment of Hatshepsut as king.
Her temple reliefs depict pacific enterprises, such as the transporting of obelisks for Amonâs temple and a commercial expedition to Punt; her art style looked back to Middle Kingdom ideals. Some warlike scenes are depicted, however, and she may have waged a campaign in Nubia. In one inscription she blamed the Hyksos for the supposedly poor state of the land before her rule, even though they had been expelled from the region more than a generation earlier.
During Hatshepsutâs ascendancy Egyptâs position in Asia may have deteriorated because of the expansion of Mitannian power in Syria. Shortly after her death, the prince of the Syrian city of Kadesh, stood with troops of 330 princes of a Syro-Palestinian coalition at Megiddo; such a force was more than merely defensive, and the intention may have been to advance against Egypt. The 330 must have represented all the places of any size in the region that were not subject to Egyptian rule and may be a schematic figure derived from a list of place-names. It is noteworthy that Mitanni itself was not directly involved.
Thutmose III proceeded to Gaza with his army and then to Yehem, subjugating rebellious Palestinian towns along the way. His annals relate how, at a consultation concerning the best route over the Mount Carmel ridge, the king overruled his officers and selected a shorter but more dangerous route through the Ê¿ArÅ«nah Pass and then led the troops himself. The march went smoothly, and, when the Egyptians attacked at dawn, they prevailed over the enemy troops and besieged Megiddo.
Thutmose III meanwhile coordinated the landing of other army divisions on the Syro-Palestinian littoral, whence they proceeded inland, so that the strategy resembled a pincer technique. The siege ended in a treaty by which Syrian princes swore an oath of submission to the king. As was normal in ancient diplomacy and in Egyptian practice, the oath was binding only upon those who swore it, not upon future generations.
By the end of the first campaign, Egyptian domination extended northward to a line linking Byblos and Damascus. Although the prince of Kadesh remained to be vanquished, Assyria sent lapis lazuli as tribute; Asian princes surrendered their weapons, including a large number of horses and chariots. Thutmose III took only a limited number of captives. He appointed Asian princes to govern the towns and took their brothers and sons to Egypt, where they were educated at the court. Most eventually returned home to serve as loyal vassals, though some remained in Egypt at court. In order to ensure the loyalty of Asian city-states, Egypt maintained garrisons that could quell insurrection and supervise the delivery of tribute. There never was an elaborate Egyptian imperial administration in Asia.
Thutmose III conducted numerous subsequent campaigns in Asia. The submission of Kadesh was finally achieved, but Thutmose IIIâs ultimate aim was the defeat of Mitanni. He used the navy to transport troops to Asian coastal towns, avoiding arduous overland marches from Egypt. His great eighth campaign led him across the Euphrates; although the countryside around Carchemish was ravaged, the city was not taken, and the Mitannian prince was able to flee. The psychological gain of this campaign was perhaps greater than its military success, for Babylonia, Assyria, and the Hittites all sent tribute in recognition of Egyptian dominance. Although Thutmose III never subjugated Mitanni, he placed Egyptâs conquests on a firm footing by constant campaigning that contrasts with the forays of his predecessors. Thutmose IIIâs annals inscribed in the temple of Karnak are remarkably succinct and accurate, but his other texts, particularly one set in his newly founded Nubian capital of Napata, are more conventional in their rhetoric. He seems to have married three Syrian wives, which may represent diplomatic unions, marking Egyptâs entry into the realm of international affairs of the ancient Middle East.
Thutmose III initiated a truly imperial Egyptian rule in Nubia. Much of the land became estates of institutions in Egypt, while local cultural traits disappear from the archaeological record. Sons of chiefs were educated at the Egyptian court; a few returned to Nubia to serve as administrators, and some were buried there in Egyptian fashion. Nubian fortresses lost their strategic value and became administrative centers. Open towns developed around them, and, in several temples outside their walls, the cult of the divine king was established. Lower Nubia supplied gold from the desert and hard and semiprecious stones. From farther south came tropical African woods, perfumes, oil, ivory, animal skins, and ostrich plumes. There is scarcely any trace of local population from the later New Kingdom, when many more temples were built in Nubia; by the end of the 20th dynasty, the region had almost no prosperous settled population.
