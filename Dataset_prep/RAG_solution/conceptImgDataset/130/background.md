# Wikipedia: Dendera Temple complex
The Dendera Temple complex (Ancient Egyptian: Iunet or Tantere; the 19th-century English spelling in most sources, including Belzoni, was Tentyra; also spelled Denderah) is located about 2.5 kilometres (1.6 miles) south-east of Dendera, Egypt. It is one of the best-preserved temple complexes of ancient Egypt. The area was used as the sixth nome of Upper Egypt, south of Abydos.

Description
The entirety of the complex is surrounded by a sizable mudbrick wall. Dendera, an oasis on the banks of the Nile, was inhabited by thousands at its peak. Due to its massive size, the structures throughout the complex were constructed over many eras, such as the Middle Kingdom, the Ptolemaic Era, and the period characterized by Roman provincial rule. There is evidence that there was an even earlier building on this site, circa 2250 B.C.E., which could have begun during the reign of Pepi I and completed during the reign of his son, Merenre Nemtyemsaf I. Evidence also exists of a temple in the Eighteenth Dynasty (ca. 1500 BC). The earliest extant (surviving) building in the compound today is the mammisi raised by Nectanebo II – last of the native pharaohs (360–343 BC).
The features in the complex include:

Hathor temple (the main temple)
Temple of the birth of Isis
Sacred Lake (source of water for sacred rituals and for everyday use)
Sanatorium
This would have functioned similarly to a Roman bathhouse, but strictly for bathing and an overnight stay to manifest healing dreams. The waters at Dendera were sacred and were often used to bless the inscriptions on statues so that they could cure diseases.

The Dendera Temple is not to be confused with the Dendera Necropolis, which consists of a series of tombs. The Dendera Necropolis dates back to the Early Dynastic Period and up to the First Intermediate Period, which pre-dates the Middle Kingdom construction of the Temple of Hathor. The necropolis runs across the eastern edge of the western hill and over the northern plain.

Hathor temple
The temple that dominates this complex, the structure that commands the attention of those who visit, is the Temple of Hathor. The original temple structure underwent continuous modifications throughout the Middle Kingdom and up until the beginning of the reign of the Roman emperor Trajan. The existing temple's structure began construction in 54 B.C.E, the late Ptolemaic period, under the reign of Ptolemy Auletes. The hypostyle hall was built in the Roman period under Tiberius.
In Egypt, Trajan was quite active in constructing buildings and decorating them. He appears, together with Domitian, in offering scenes on the propylaeum of the Temple of Hathor. His cartouche also appears in the column shafts of the Temple of Khnum at Esna.
Layout elements of the temple are:

Large Hypostyle Hall
Small Hypostyle Hall
Laboratory
Storage magazine
Offering entry
Treasury
Exit to well
Access to stairwell

Shrine of Hathor
Shrine of the throne of Rê
Shrine of Rê
Shrine of Menat collar

Passage
Staircase to roof
Depictions of Cleopatra VI, which appear on temple walls, are good examples of Ptolemaic Egyptian art. On the rear of the temple exterior is a carving of Cleopatra VII Philopator (the popular, well-known Cleopatra) and her son, Ptolemy XV Philopator Philometor Caesar (Caesarion), who was fathered by Julius Caesar.
There are ten dead deities represented at Dendera, specifically on/in Hathor's temple, that can be connected to the nine dead deities at Horus's temple in Edfu. This would be due to the either parental or marital relationship between Hathor and Horus.

Dendera zodiac
The sculptured Dendera zodiac (or Denderah zodiac) is a widely known relief found in a late Greco-Roman temple, containing images of the zodiac system still recognized today (i.e. Taurus [bull] and Libra [scales]). A sketch was made during the Napoleonic campaign in Egypt. In 1820 it was removed from the temple ceiling by French colonizers and later replaced with a copy. There is controversy as to whether they were granted permission by Egypt's ruler, Muhammad Ali Pasha, to do so, or whether they stole it. (It is also said that in 1822, an antiquities thief using the name "Claude Le Lorraine" [not to be confused with the French Baroque painter] removed the zodiac from Dendera, brought it back to France, and sold it to the King.) The real one is now in the Louvre. Jean-François Champollion, the man who deciphered the Rosetta Stone, dated it back to the Ptolemaic period, and it has been proved that he was correct, as Egyptologists now date it back to the first century BC.

Crypts
The Hathor temple's subterranean tombs contain twelve chambers. Some reliefs seen in the tombs are dated to as late as the reign of Ptolemy XII Auletes. The crypts reportedly were used for storing vessels and divine iconography. An opening in the Flame Room floor leads to a narrow chamber with representations on the walls of the objects which were kept in them. In the second chamber, a relief depicts Pepi I offering a statuette of the God Ihy to four images of Hathor. (Hathor is understood to be Ihy's mother.) In the crypt accessible from the Throne Room, Ptolemy XII has jewelry and offerings for the gods.

The Dendera light
The Hathor Temple has stone reliefs that depict Harsomtus, in the form of a snake, emerging from a lotus flower. Harsomtus, also known as Horus, is depicted as one of the ancient gods, a "primeval creator." Harsomtus is likely depicted at the Dendera Temple Complex due to the main temple being dedicated to Hathor. In Egyptian mythology, Harsomtus is referenced as either Hathor's son or lover. In six reliefs he is positioned within an oval container called a hn, which might represent the womb of Nut. These resemble a lamp or light.

Processional staircase
There is a processional stairway leading to the roof of the temple. Reliefs decorating the walls depict scenes from rituals that would have been performed at the temple. The staircase shows wear from millennia of use, but it also shows an apparent accretion of material, which has lent the staircase the informal name of "the melted stairs."

Restoration work
The Supreme Council of Antiquities began the project of restoration and maintenance of the temple in 2005. Efforts stopped in 2011 and then resumed in 2017, after the completion of necessary scientific and archaeological studies, along with careful experimental studies using modern techniques. As of March 2021, the second phase of the restoration has been completed, which includes cleaning the Great Pillars Hall and restoring the original colors and clarity of painted scenes on walls and ceilings. More activity continues at the temple, including a cooperative effort started in 2019 with the French Archaeological delegation to turn the temple courtyard into an open museum.

Roman mammisi
The Roman mammisi is a subsidiary building dating to the reigns of Trajan and Marcus Aurelius. Numerous reliefs of Trajan making offerings to Egyptian deities can be seen. The presence of the Roman mammisi at the Dendera Temple Complex is indicative of the long and complicated history of the Romans in Egypt. As seen in the images below, Roman Emperor Trajan is depicted in the reliefs as an Egyptian Pharaoh and he is making offerings to the Egyptian gods.

Recent discoveries
In March 2023, during the recent excavations at the site archaeologists uncovered a limestone sphinx. This sphinx is depicted with a slight grin and dimples and is thought to have been created in the image of the Roman emperor Claudius. On the sphinx's head sits a nemes that has a cobra-shaped tip called a uraeus.

Tourism
The Dendera complex has long been one of the most tourist-accessible ancient Egyptian places of worship. It is  possible to visit virtually every part of the complex, from the crypts to the roof (at least in February 2025).

The Dandarah Temple complex, located on the Nile's west bank in Upper Egypt,
is situated in the agricultural town of Dandarah, the site of the ancient city
of Ta-ynt-netert (She of the Divine Pillar), or Tentyra. This temple was the
main temple for the goddess Hathor.

The current sandstone temple dates back to the Ptolemaic Period (305–30 BCE)
and was finished by the Roman emperor Tiberius (14–37 CE), though it is built
on the foundations of earlier structures that date back to Khufu's reign (c.
2575–c. 2465 BCE). The temple is approximately 260 feet (79 meters) long and
is located within an 83,600-square-meter area surrounded by a dried mud brick
wall. The temple has a large hypostyle hall with 18 Hathor-headed columns and
elaborate decorations. Astronomical scenes are carved into the ceiling, while
the walls depict details of a royal visit.

Within the temple complex, there is a smaller temple of Isis located behind
the main temple, a sacred lake on the north side, and a gate of Mentuhotep II
(reigned 2008–1957 BCE). Additionally, there are two birth-houses and a
Christian church east of the sacred lake.

Dandarah,  agricultural town on the west bank of the Nile, in Qinā muḥāfaẓah (governorate), Upper Egypt. The modern town is built on the ancient site of Ta-ynt-netert (She of the Divine Pillar), or Tentyra. It was the capital of the sixth nome (province) of pharaonic Upper Egypt and was dedicated to the sky and fertility goddess Hathor. Her temple is one of the best preserved in Egypt. The present building dates to the Ptolemaic Period (305–30 bce) and was completed by the Roman emperor Tiberius (14–37 ce), but it rests on the foundations of earlier buildings dating back at least as far as Khufu (second king of the 4th dynasty [c. 2575–c. 2465 bce]).
The sandstone temple is approximately 260 feet (79 metres) long and was built within a 900,000-square-foot (83,600-square-metre) area enclosed by a wall of dried mud brick. Within the temple a great, elaborately decorated hypostyle hall is supported by 18 Hathor-headed columns, giving it a forestlike appearance. The ceiling is carved with astronomical scenes and the walls with the details of a royal visit. Off the hall a smaller one with six columns is surrounded by six magazines, and it, in turn, leads into two vestibules, the second of which opens into the sanctuary where the sacred boat was kept containing the image of the goddess. On the roof of the temple are several chapels dedicated to the god Osiris, in one of which a zodiac and sundial, now in Paris, were discovered.
Behind the temple lies a small temple of Isis. On the north side is a sacred lake. There also was found a gate of Mentuhotep II (reigned 2008–1957 bce), now in the Cairo Museum. Two birth-houses and a Christian church stand east of the sacred lake. Pop. (2001 est.) 27,500.
