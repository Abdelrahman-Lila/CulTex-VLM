# Wikipedia: El Ferdan Railway Bridge
The El Ferdan Railway Bridge is a swing bridge that spans the western shipping lane of the Suez Canal near Ismailia, Egypt. It is the longest swing bridge in the world, with a span of 1,100 feet (340 m).
The bridge was not functional for a while due to the expansion of the Suez Canal completed in 2015 which added a parallel shipping lane just east of the existing bridge, cutting off the railway into Sinai. As of 2021 a second swing bridge spanning the new eastern shipping lane was under construction and started operating in 2024.

History
The first El Ferdan Railway Bridge over the Suez Canal was completed in April 1918 for the Sinai Military Railway. It was considered a hindrance to shipping so after the First World War it was removed. A steel swing bridge was built in 1942 (during the Second World War), but this was damaged by a steamship and removed in 1947. A double swing bridge was completed in 1954 but the 1956 Anglo-Franco-Israeli war with Egypt severed rail traffic across the canal for a third time. A replacement bridge was completed in 1963 which was destroyed in 1967 in the Six-Day War by the Egyptian engineering General Ahmed Hamdy.
In July 1996, a consortium led by German Krupp was awarded a $US70 million contract to design and build the bridge, raised to $80 million to increase the main span from 320 to 340 m (1,050 to 1,120 ft).
The current bridge was constructed in 2001.

Significant developments in the region
The El Ferdan Railway Bridge was part of a major drive to develop the areas surrounding the Suez Canal, including other projects such as the Ahmed Hamdi Tunnel under the Suez Canal (completed in 1983), the Suez Canal overhead powerline crossing, and the Suez Canal Bridge (completed in 2001, roughly 12 miles north of the El Ferdan Railway Bridge).

The bridge today: plans for upgrading tracks and building a new bridge
The parallel New Suez Canal was excavated in 2014/2015 a short distance to the east but without a bridge spanning it. Without a second bridge, the railway across El Ferdan bridge is a dead end.
Initially, a plan was in place to construct a new railway tunnel in the Ismailia region (and another near Port Said is planned) in order to reconnect the Sinai to the rest of Egypt's rail network. However, Kamel ElWazir, who was at that time the head of the Egyptian Armed Forces - Engineering corps, announced that due to high costs the plans for a new tunnel would be scrapped and that the Engineering Corps would seek other alternatives including moving the existing bridge to a narrow section of the canal at El-Qantara.
However, the final decision was made in 2017 to keep the existing bridge at its current location and build a new double-track railway bridge (based on the current El Ferdan bridge design) across the new, eastern shipping lane several hundred meters to the east. The existing bridge over the western shipping lane would be converted from a single-track railway to a double-track railway. This was near completion in October 2023.

# Britannica:
The El Ferdan Bridge, opened November 14, 2001, is the longest rotating metal
bridge in the world. It spans the Suez Canal in northeastern Egypt, from the
lower Nile River valley near Ismailia to the Sinai Peninsula. The bridge has a
single railway track in the middle, with two lanes for vehicular traffic.

The El Ferdan Bridge is a swing, or double-cantilever, bridge that is 2,099
feet (640 meters) long. Its steel truss superstructure is 41 feet (12.6
meters) wide and 197 feet (60 meters) high at the pivot. Each steel arm can
swing open 90°, creating a navigational space 1,050 feet (320 meters) wide, a
process that takes about 15 minutes.

A consortium of German, Belgian, and Egyptian companies designed and
constructed the El Ferdan Bridge. It is the fifth bridge to be built across
the Suez Canal, replacing another railway bridge destroyed during the Six-Day
War in 1967. The bridge was an important component of Egypt’s National Scheme
for Sinai Development, reconnecting the peninsula’s only railway line, which
runs some 225 miles (360 km) from Ismailia to Rafah. It was meant to be a
catalyst for agricultural and industrial development in the region and made it
possible to cross between Africa and Asia in just a few minutes.

El-Ferdan Bridge,  longest rotating metal bridge in the world, spanning the western shipping lane of the Suez Canal in northeastern Egypt, from the lower Nile River valley near Ismailia to the Sinai Peninsula. Opened on November 14, 2001, the bridge has a single railway track running down the middle that is flanked by two 10-foot- (3-metre-) wide lanes for high-speed vehicular traffic. Also called a swing, or double-cantilever, bridge, the structure is 2,099 feet (640 metres) long and has a steel truss superstructure 41 feet (12.6 metres) wide and 197 feet (60 metres) high at the pivot. Each giant steel arm swings open 90°, creating a navigational space 1,050 feet (320 metres) wide. This process takes about 15 minutes.
El-Ferdan Bridge was designed and constructed by a consortium of German, Belgian, and Egyptian companies. The fifth bridge to be built across the Suez Canal, it replaced another railway bridge destroyed during the Arab-Israeli conflict (Six-Day War) in 1967. The project was completed in less than five years and was an important component of Egypt’s National Scheme for Sinai Development; it reconnected the peninsula’s only railway line, which runs some 225 miles (360 km) from Ismailia to Rafah. The bridge was meant to be a catalyst for agricultural and industrial development in the region, but it was also geopolitically significant because it made it possible to cross between Africa and Asia in just a few minutes.
