# Wikipedia: Abu Haggag Mosque
The Mosque of Abu Haggag (Arabic: مسجد أبو الحجاج بالأقصر) is a mosque in Luxor, Egypt. It contains the tomb of Sheikh Yusuf Abu al-Haggag, after whom the mosque is named. The mosque is integrated into the structure of Luxor Temple, an Ancient Egyptian centre of worship, making it one of the oldest continuously used temples in the world, dating back to the reign of Pharaoh Amenhotep III in the 14th century BC.

History
The mosque was built during the Ayyubid era of Egypt, specifically during the reign of As-Salih Najm al-Din Ayyub. It was built on the site of a demolished basilica located within the premises of the Luxor Temple.
In 2009, the mosque underwent restoration efforts. It took two years under the supervision of the Supreme Council of Antiquities, and its cost amounted to seven million Egyptian pounds. The new architecture included expanding the prayer square, strengthening the dome, and changing the ceilings, after the mosque was exposed to a fire in June 2007, and during that restoration. During construction, columns and lintels appeared bearing ancient Egyptian writings from the time of Pharaoh Ramesses II.

Architecture
The mosque stands within the court of Ramesses II. This part of the Luxor Temple was converted to a basilica by the Coptic Christians in 395 AD, and then to a mosque in 640. The site therefore has seen 3400 years of continuous religious use, making the Luxor Temple the oldest building in the world at least partially still in use, for purposes other than archeological or tourist use.

The mosque has two minarets, made out of mud brick. The minarets are one of the oldest components of the current mosque. The older one consists of three floors; the first is square in shape, the second and third are cylindrical, and at the top is a group of windows and openings, and the square bottom part is reinforced with wooden columns.
The tomb of Yusuf Abu al-Hajjaj is located under the dome of the mosque. The ceiling of this tomb chamber is composed of a base of irregular dimensions, which descends until it reaches the circular shape of the dome.

Mawlid celebration
The annual birthday celebration, or Mawlid, of Yusuf Abu el-Haggag is celebrated in the mosque. The celebration culminates 15 days before Ramadan and attracts large numbers of pilgrims. During this festival, a procession of boats parade around the temple, typically carried by the descendants of el-Haggag. These boats symbolise el-Haggag’s journey to Egypt. Residents of Luxor dress up in colourful outfits and attend the mawlid festival for three days. Activities of the festival often include horse races, performances of sufi music, stick fights and boat rides. Inside the mosque, the descendants of el-Haggag hold a council known as Al-Dayem, raise religious chanting, sing prophetic praises and read the Qur’an.
The celebrations bear a resemblance to Pharaonic rituals, being strongly reminiscent of the Opet. Ahmed Abu Haggag, an organiser of the event, has stated: “The mawlid celebrations feature ancient rituals and customs that are greatly intertwined with the pharaonic festivals”.
The celebration is habitually attended by those who hold significant governmental positions in Luxor.

Eternal Egypt: Mosque of Abu Haggag Archived 2016-03-03 at the Wayback Machine
# Britannica:
The Abu Haggag Mosque was built during the Fāṭimid period (909–1171) over the
foundations of a church in the court of Luxor Temple. The mosque was dedicated
to Sheikh Yūsuf al-Ḥaggāg, a local saint who is said to have introduced Islam
to Luxor.

The feast of Sheikh Yūsuf al-Ḥaggāg is celebrated with a boat procession
resembling the ancient rite, the festival of Opet. During this festival, Amon
was said to come from Karnak on his state barge to visit his temple at Luxor,
escorted by the people of Thebes.

Luxor,  city and capital of Al-Uqṣur muḥāfaẓah (governorate), Upper Egypt. Luxor has given its name to the southern half of the ruins of the ancient Egyptian city of Thebes. Area governorate, 1,080 square miles (2,800 square km); city, 160 square miles (415 square km). Pop. (2017) governorate, 1,250,209; (2018 est.) city, 127,994.
The southern part of Thebes grew up around a beautiful temple dedicated to Amon, king of the gods, his consort Mut, and their son Khons. Commissioned by King Amenhotep III (Amenophis III; reigned 1390–53 bce) of the late 18th dynasty, the temple was built close to the Nile River and parallel with the bank and is known today as the Temple of Luxor. An avenue of sphinxes connected it to the Great Temple of Amon at Karnak. The modern name Luxor (Arabic: Al-Uqṣur) means “The Palaces” or perhaps “The Forts,” from the Roman castra.
A small pavilion is all that is left of previous building on the site, though there probably was a temple there earlier in the 18th dynasty if not before. Amenhotep III’s temple was completed by Tutankhamen (reigned 1333–23) and Horemheb (1319–1292). Ramses II (1279–13) added another court, a pylon, and obelisks; smaller additions were made to the temple in Ptolemaic times. Its hypostyle hall was at one time converted into a Christian church, and the remains of another Coptic church can be seen to the west of it.
The original part of the Temple of Luxor consisted of a large peristyle court and a complex of halls and chambers beyond. In one hall is a granite shrine of Alexander the Great. The great peristyle forecourt is surrounded on three sides by a double row of graceful papyrus-cluster columns, their capitals imitating the umbels of the papyrus plant in bud. An entrance flanked by the towers of a pylon was planned for the north end, but this design was altered, and, instead, the most striking feature of the temple, a majestic colonnade of 14 pillars, 52 feet (16 metres) high, was added. This colonnade, which also has papyrus-umbel capitals, may have been intended for the central nave of a hypostyle hall similar to that at Karnak, but the side aisles were not built; instead, enclosing walls were built down either side. Ramses II added an outer court, decorated with colossal statues of himself between the pillars of a double colonnade, and a lofty pylon on which he depicted festival scenes and episodes from his wars in Syria. In front of the pylon were colossal statues of the pharaoh (some of which remain) and a pair of obelisks, one of which still stands; the other was removed in 1831 and reerected in the Place de la Concorde in Paris.
When Thebes declined politically, Luxor remained the populated part of the town, which huddled around the Ramesside pylon. A Roman legion had its headquarters inside the 18th-dynasty temple, and Coptic churches were built around the temple and in the Ramesside court. In the Fāṭimid period (909–1171), a mosque was built over the foundations of the church in the court; the mosque was dedicated to Sheikh Yūsuf al-Ḥaggāg, a local saint who is reputed to have introduced Islam to Luxor. His feast is celebrated with a boat procession resembling an ancient rite, the festival of Opet, during which, on the 19th day of the second month, Amon was said to come from Karnak on his state barge to visit his other temple at Luxor, escorted by the people of Thebes in holiday attire. Reliefs on the walls of the great colonnade depict preparations for the procession of sacred barks during the festival.
Luxor, together with other Theban sites—Karnak, the Valley of the Queens, and the Valley of the Kings—was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1979. Excavations and preservation efforts have been ongoing. In 1988 the Egyptian Antiquities Organization uncovered numerous 18th-dynasty statues at the court of Amenhotep III, and work to excavate and preserve the court continued through the following decades. In the 21st century a project began to excavate the avenue of sphinxes between the Temple of Luxor and the Great Temple of Amon at Karnak.
The contemporary city, a market town for the surrounding agricultural district, has grown north, south, and east of the temple. It has a number of churches, as a large proportion of the population is Christian, and mosques. There is also a railway station on the Cairo-Aswān railroad, an airport, and ferry service to the western bank. The Luxor Museum was opened in 1975. Numerous tourist facilities were built in the latter part of the 20th century.
