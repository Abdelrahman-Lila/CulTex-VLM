Sharm el-Sheikh is a resort town on the southeastern coast of the Sinai
Peninsula, Egypt. Its modern importance arose from its strategic position
commanding the narrow entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba.

The development of the area as a recreational and tourist site began under
Israeli administration and was continued by the Egyptian government. Today,
luxury resorts, restaurants, and nightclubs line the coast. Sharm el-Sheikh's
clear water and extensive coral reefs have made it a popular site for
snorkeling and scuba diving. The city’s proximity to several prominent Middle
Eastern countries and its luxurious accommodations have made it an attractive
location for a number of international peace conferences, gaining Sharm el-
Sheikh special recognition from UNESCO as a city of peace.

Sharm el-Sheikh,  resort town on the southeastern coast of the Sinai Peninsula. Located in Janūb Sīnāʾ muḥāfaẓah (governorate), Egypt, the area was occupied from 1967 to 1982 by the Israelis, who began building the town as a tourist destination. Its development as such continued after being returned to Egypt.
Sharm el-Sheikh was uninhabited throughout most of historical time due to its prohibitive climate, but it gained modern importance because of its strategic situation commanding the narrow entrance to the Gulf of Aqaba. The entrance is 14 miles (23 km) northeast of Sharm el-Sheikh’s bay, at the Strait of Tiran. The strait, which is blocked by islets and coral reefs, is hemmed in by the Raʾs Naṣrānī cape on the west and by Tiran Island on the east. After Israel’s War of Independence (1948–49), Egyptian guns were installed in the area to prevent shipping from reaching Elat, Israel’s only port on the Gulf of Aqaba. The installations were captured by Israelis in the Sinai Campaign of 1956 (see Suez Crisis), and the bay and strait were guarded by a United Nations Emergency Force from 1957 to 1967. Egypt’s withdrawal of the UN force and its closure of the strait in May 1967 helped precipitate the Six-Day War of June 1967. Following that war, Israel again occupied the area until Israeli forces withdrew from the Sinai Peninsula in the early 1980s in fulfillment of the Camp David Accords peace agreement negotiated with the Egyptians.
The development of the area as a recreational and tourist site began under the Israeli administration and was continued by the Egyptian government. Today luxury resorts, restaurants, and nightclubs line the coast. The area’s clear water and extensive coral reefs have made Sharm el-Sheikh a popular site for snorkeling and scuba diving. The city’s proximity to several prominent Middle Eastern countries and its luxurious accommodations have made it an attractive location for a number of international peace conferences, gaining Sharm el-Sheikh special recognition from UNESCO as a city of peace.
