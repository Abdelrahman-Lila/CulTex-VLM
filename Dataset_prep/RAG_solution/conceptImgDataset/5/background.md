Bayt al-Suhaymi ("House of Suhaymi") is a traditional Egyptian Islamic themed house and museum in Cairo, Egypt. It was originally built in 1648 by Abdel Wahab el Tablawy along the Darb al-Asfar, a very prestigious and expensive part of Islamic Cairo.  In 1796 it was purchased by Sheikh Ahmed as-Suhaymi, whose family held it for several subsequent generations. The Sheikh greatly extended the house from its original through incorporating neighbouring houses into its structure.
The house is built around a sahn, in the centre of which there is a small garden with plants and palm trees.  From here several of the fine mashrabiya windows in the house can be seen.  Today the house is a museum which foreign visitors can tour for 220 Egyptian pounds (110 for students).  Much of the marble floor work, wooden furniture, and ceiling decor is still intact. Restoration took place after the earthquake of 1992.
