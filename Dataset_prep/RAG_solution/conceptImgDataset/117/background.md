# Wikipedia: Amr ibn al-As Mosque (Damietta)
The Amr ibn al-As Mosque (Arabic: مَسْجِد عَمْرِو بْنِ الْعَاصِ, romanized: Masjid ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ), also known as the Abu'l-Ma'ati Mosque or Al-Fateh Mosque, is a historic mosque in Damietta, Egypt. According to some local sources, it is the second mosque to be built in Egypt, named for Amr ibn al-As, one of the Companions of the Prophet who led the Arab conquest of Egypt. It was temporarily the Cathedral of the Holy Virgin during the Crusader occupation of Damietta.

History
Rashidun period
The Arabs under the Rashidun Caliphate successfully conquered Egypt in 642. Miqdad ibn Aswad is said to have built a mosque in Damietta, incorporating older Roman-period columns into the structure. Bernard O'Kane, professor of Islamic architecture at the American University in Cairo, has expressed doubt that the present-day mosque corresponds to this original mosque.

Abbasid period
Damietta was attacked by the Byzantines during the reign of Abbasid Caliph Al-Mutawakkil. The mosque was attacked with fire and burnt, but eventually rebuilt after the attacks had been repelled.

Fatimid period
The mosque was renovated during the Fatimid rule in 1106. The structure was expanded to accommodate more worshippers as well.

Fifth Crusade
After the siege of Damietta in 1218–1219, the Crusaders under John of Brienne occupied Damietta. The mosque was converted into a cathedral. On 2 February 1220, the Feast of the Purification, Cardinal Pelagius renamed the mosque to the Cathedral of the Holy Virgin. However, the Crusaders were defeated during the Fifth Crusade, so they surrendered and left Damietta in 1221. The mosque was restored to its original function in the same year.

Seventh Crusade
In June 1249, the army of the Seventh Crusade besieged Damietta under Louis IX of France. The mosque was again converted into a cathedral where religious ceremonies were held. In 1250, Louis's son John Tristan was baptized in the cathedral. However, the Crusaders lost the Battle of Fariskur which resulted in Louis IX being captured and held hostage. Louis was forced to cede Damietta back to the Ayyubids, and the cathedral was abandoned.

Mamluk period
On the orders of the new Mamluk sultan, Aybak, Damietta was demolished in 1251 to prevent the Crusaders from using it again in the future. A new city was created further south. However, the Mamluks kept the cathedral and reconverted it into a mosque. The mosque was given a wooden minbar that was completed in 1369 and crafted by a woodworker named Ahmad ibn Yusuf.

Modern era
The mosque was neglected for decades, until the year 2004 when plans were made to restore it. The original structure was completely ruined and the new building is a reconstruction. The works were done by The Arab Contractors, and it took five years to complete. On 8 May 2009, the mosque was reopened to the public. The opening day coincided with the day Louis IX and his Crusaders left Damietta, returning it to the Muslims.

Architecture
The Amr ibn al-As mosque of Damietta is built in a similar way to the one in Fustat. It has a courtyard in the center which holds a domed ablution fountain. On the western side is the main entrance to the mosque, overlooking Al Jabana Street. Next to the entrance is a square room, formerly the base of a minaret which was destroyed during an earthquake. The mosque's area totals up to 3420 square metres, making it one of the largest mosques in Egypt.

# Britannica:
I am unable to provide information about the Amr Ibn al-Aas Mosque in Damietta
specifically. However, I can provide information about the Mosque of Amr ibn
al-'Ās, the earliest Islamic building in Egypt.

The Mosque of Amr ibn al-'Ās was erected in 641 by Amr ibn al-'Ās in Al-Fusṭāṭ
(present-day Cairo). Amr ibn al-'Ās was the Arab conqueror of Egypt and a
capable government administrator. He founded the garrison city of Al-Fusṭāṭ
adjacent to Babylon, where he built the mosque bearing his name.

The mosque has been destroyed and restored so often that it is impossible to
know the appearance of the first building. It was demolished and rebuilt in
698, rebuilt again in 827, and restored by Saladin in 1172 after al-Fusṭāṭ was
burned by crusaders. The present mosque is a 19th-century reconstruction that
still preserves design elements and ornamental work from various periods of
the building’s history.

Mosque of ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ,  earliest Islāmic building in Egypt, erected in 641 by ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ, the leader of an invading Arab army. The mosque was built in Al-Fusṭāṭ, a city that grew out of an Arab army encampment on the site of present-day Cairo.
Though originally a modest structure, it was destroyed and restored so often that it is impossible to know the appearance of the first building. The Umayyad ʿAbd al-ʿAzīz ibn Marwan demolished the mosque and rebuilt it, probably following closely the original dimensions, in 698. In 827 the ʿAbbāsids rebuilt it, doubling its size. The mosque was restored by Saladin in 1172 after the city of al-Fusṭāṭ was burned by crusaders. After periodic cycles of ruin and restoration, the mosque was left to decay with the coming of Napoleon Bonaparte’s troops to Cairo in 1798. The present mosque is a 19th-century reconstruction that still preserves design elements and ornamental work from various periods of the building’s history.

## Britannica: ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ | Islamic Conquest, Prophet Muhammad, Egypt | Britannica
ʿAmr ibn al-ʿĀṣ  (died 663, Al-Fusṭāṭ, Egypt) was the Arab conqueror of Egypt.
A wealthy member of the Banū Sahm clan of the important tribe of Quraysh, ʿAmr accepted Islām in 629–630. Sent to Oman, in southeastern Arabia, by the Prophet Muḥammad, he successfully completed his first mission by converting its rulers to Islām. As the leader of one of the three military forces sent to Palestine by the caliph Abū Bakr, he took part in the battles of Ajnādayn (634) and the Yarmūk River (636) and was responsible for the Muslim conquest of southwestern Palestine. He achieved lasting fame, however, for his conquest of Egypt—a campaign that, according to some sources, he undertook on his own initiative. After defeating large Byzantine forces at Heliopolis (now a suburb of Cairo) in 640 and Babylon (a Byzantine town on the site of the present Old Cairo) in 641, he entered the capital, Alexandria, in 642.
A successful general, ʿAmr was also a capable government administrator and an astute politician. In Egypt he organized the system of taxation and the administration of justice and founded the garrison city of Al-Fusṭāṭ adjacent to Babylon, where he built a mosque (still standing) bearing his name. At the Battle of Ṣiffīn (657), fought to decide the succession to the caliphate, he sided with Muʿāwiyah I, governor of Syria, against ʿAlī, the fourth caliph of Islām. In the ensuing arbitration, he faithfully represented Muʿāwiyah, who rewarded him with the governorship of Egypt at the advent of the Umayyad caliphate (named for the Banū Umayyah clan of Muʿāwiyah) in 661.

## Britannica: Damietta | Port City, Nile Delta | Britannica
Damietta,  city, capital of Dumyāṭ muḥāfaẓah (governorate), in the Nile River delta, Lower Egypt, on the Mediterranean coast. Damietta, the port of the governorate, is located 8 miles (13 km) from the Mediterranean, on the right (east) bank of the Damietta branch of the Nile. The name is a corruption of the ancient Coptic Tamiati.
Damietta was an important city of ancient Egypt and was formerly closer to the sea than it is at present. It declined with the development of Alexandria (after 322 bce). In 638 ce it fell to Arab invaders, who made it a commercial centre famous for its textiles. Frequently attacked by the Crusaders, it was only briefly in their hands (1219–21; 1249–50). The settlement’s vulnerability to sea attacks led the Mamlūk sultan Baybars I (reigned 1260–77) to raze the town and fortifications, block access to the Damietta branch of the river, and erect a new town called Damietta 4 miles (6.4 km) inland on the present site. During both the Mamlūk and the Ottoman periods, the town was used as a place of banishment. After the construction in 1819 of the Maḥmūdiyyah Canal, which diverted much of the Nile’s shipping to Alexandria, Damietta’s importance as a trade centre diminished, although it retained some trade, principally with Syria.
In modern times dredging of the channel revived Damietta’s port; the port facilities were upgraded to relieve the overcrowding at Alexandria, but much traffic has been diverted to the west of Alexandria or east to Port Said. The city’s industries include furniture and clothing manufacturing, leatherworking, flour milling, and fishing. The city has several fine mosques. Damietta is linked to Cairo by rail via Banhā (Benha) and to Port Said and the Suez Canal zone by highway. Pop. (2006) 206,664.
