Coptic Cairo (Arabic: القاهرة القبطية, romanized: al-Qāhira al-Qibṭiyya, lit. Coptic Cairo) is a part of Old Cairo which encompasses the Babylon Fortress, the Coptic Museum, the Hanging Church, the Greek Church of St. George and many other Coptic churches and historical sites. It is believed in Christian tradition that the Holy Family visited this area and stayed at the site of Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church (Abu Serga). Coptic Cairo was a stronghold for Christianity in Egypt both before and during the Islamic era, as most of its churches were built after the Muslim conquest of Egypt in the 7th century.

History
Ancient and Roman periods
There is evidence of settlement in the area as early as the 6th century BC, when Persians built a fort on the Nile, north of Memphis. The Persians also built a canal from the Nile (at Fustat) to the Red Sea. The Persian settlement was called Babylon, reminiscent of the ancient city along the Euphrates, and it gained importance while the nearby city of Memphis declined, as did Heliopolis. During the Ptolemaic period, Babylon and its people were mostly forgotten.

Early Christianity and Roman persecution
It is traditionally held that the Holy Family visited the area during the Flight into Egypt, seeking refuge from Herod. Further, it is held that Christianity began to spread in Egypt when St. Mark arrived in Alexandria, becoming the first Patriarch, though the religion remained underground during the rule of the Romans. As the local population began to organize towards a revolt, the Romans, recognising the strategic importance of the region, took over the fort and relocated it nearby as the Babylon Fortress. Trajan reopened the canal to the Red Sea, bringing increased trade.
Over the first three centuries of the Current Era, a substantial portion of the population of Egypt converted from pagan beliefs to Christianity. They were, however, subjected to persecution by certain Roman emperors, mainly Diocletian around 300 AD. The persecutions ended following the Edict of Milan that declared religious toleration. The Coptic Church later separated from the church of the Romans and the Byzantines. During the reign of Arcadius (395–408), several churches were built in Old Cairo.

Islamic conquest and early Muslim rule
When the Muslim Arabs conquered Egypt in the 7th century, they established a new city, Fustat, outside the walls of the Babylon Fortress. Fustat became the administrative capital of Egypt and replaced Alexandria as its most important city. In the early years of Arab rule, the Copts were allowed to build several churches within the old fortress area. Some of the oldest churches in Cairo, the Church of Saint Barbara and the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus are dated to around this time, from the late 7th or early 8th century.
There may also have been a Jewish presence in the area in the early period of Muslim rule. A traditional account claims that the Ben Ezra Synagogue was converted from a church sold to the Jews by the Coptic community in 882 to pay a tribute demanded by the governor of Egypt, Ahmad Ibn Tulun. This story is generally not accepted at face value by modern scholars. Documents in the Cairo Geniza provide evidence of a possible Jewish presence as early as the 6th century, though the current building is the result of a reconstruction in the 1890s.

Fatimid and later periods
In the Fatimid period, the Coptic Patriarchate was moved from Alexandria to Fustat during the patriarchate of Cyril II (1078–1092), due to the demands of the Fatimid grand vizier, Badr al-Jamali, who wished for the Coptic pope to stay close to the capital. The new seat of the Patriarchate became the Church of the Virgin, now known as the Hanging Church, and the Saint Mercurius Church (located a short distance north of the old fortress). These two churches served as the residences of the Coptic pope and as venues for the consecrations of new popes and other important religious events. In the 14th century, the seat was moved to the Church of the Virgin Mary in Harat Zuwayla, in what was then central Cairo.

With the fall of the Fatimids and the rise of the Ayyubid dynasty in the 12th century, Muslim authorities became less tolerant and open-minded towards Christians and the construction of any new churches was strictly forbidden. Despite this, Coptic art and literature still flourished. A number of western European travelers also visited Old Cairo during this period and wrote descriptions of the ancient fortress and its churches. The interiors of churches were embellished with new furnishings and works of art, including the elaborate wooden altar screens seen in some of the churches here today.
During the 17th century, as the religious climate under the Ottomans became more open again, restoration and reconstruction of churches resumed on a more significant scale. In addition to the building activity, patronage of the arts grew and a large number of church icons preserved today were commissioned in the 18th and 19th centuries.
By the late 19th century, however, many churches were suffering from neglect. The situation was improved in part thanks to the Comité de Conservation des Monuments de l'Art Arabe, an agency established in 1881 to restore and conserve Cairo's historic monuments. Starting in 1897, the Comité was given a budget to safeguard Coptic monuments in particular, aided by funding from the Coptic patriarchate. Another aspect of this conservation effort was the opening of the Coptic Museum in 1910 to house and protect historic works of Coptic art, relevant artefacts from archaeological excavations, and decorative architectural elements drawn from churches and houses around the country. It now houses the world's most important collection of Coptic art.

St. George was an early Christian martyr who lived in the 3rd century.
Tradition holds that he was a Roman soldier who was tortured and decapitated
during the Diocletian persecution of Christians in 303. He is the patron saint
of England and Georgia and is venerated as one of the 14 Auxiliary Saints.

The Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria is the principal Christian church in
Egypt. In the 4th and 5th centuries, a theological conflict arose between the
Copts and the Greek-speaking Romans in Egypt. The Coptic church rejected the
Council of Chalcedon's (451) affirmation of both the divinity and humanity of
Jesus Christ, adopting miaphysitism, which holds that Christ's humanity and
divinity were equally present through the Incarnation in one single nature.



## Britannica: Saint George | Facts, Legends, & Feast Day | Britannica
St. George (flourished 3rd century—died, traditionally Lydda, Palestine [now Lod, Israel]; feast day April 23) was an early Christian martyr who during the Middle Ages became an ideal of martial valour and selflessness. He is the patron saint of England and of Georgia and is venerated as one of the 14 Auxiliary Saints (Holy Helpers).
Nothing of George’s life or deeds can be established, but tradition holds that he was a Roman soldier and was tortured and decapitated under Diocletian’s persecution of Christians in 303. His remains were taken to Lydda (now Lod, Israel), the homeland of his mother, and were later transferred to the church that was built in his name there. Various relics reportedly are housed in both Western and Eastern churches worldwide. St. George’s Chapel of Windsor Castle, for example, is said to have once held two fingers, part of the heart, and part of the skull of the saint.
Legends about him as a warrior-saint, dating from the 6th century, became popular and increasingly extravagant. Jacob de Voragine’s Legenda aurea (1265–66; Golden Legend) repeats the story of his rescuing a Libyan king’s daughter from a dragon and then slaying the monster in return for a promise by the king’s subjects to be baptized. George’s slaying of the dragon may be a Christian version of the legend of Perseus, who was said to have rescued Andromeda from a sea monster near Lydda. It is a theme much represented in art, the saint frequently being depicted as a youth wearing knight’s armour with a scarlet cross.
George was known in England by at least the 8th century. Returning Crusaders likely popularized his cult (he was said to have been seen helping the Franks at the Battle of Antioch in 1098), but he was probably not recognized as England’s patron saint until after King Edward III (reigned 1327–77) made him the patron of the newly founded Most Noble Order of the Garter. He was also adopted as protector of several other medieval powers, including Portugal, Genoa, and Venice. With the passing of the chivalric age and finally the Protestant Reformation, the cult of St. George dwindled. His feast is given a lesser status in the calendar of the Church of England; a holy day of obligation for English Roman Catholics until the late 18th century, it is now an optional memorial for local observance.

## Britannica: Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria | History, Beliefs & Practices | Britannica
Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria,  Oriental Orthodox church and principal Christian church in predominantly Muslim Egypt. The people of Egypt before the Arab conquest in the 7th century identified themselves and their language in Greek as Aigyptios (Arabic qibṭ, Westernized as Copt). When Egyptian Muslims later ceased to call themselves Aigyptioi, the term became the distinctive name of the Christian minority. In the 19th and 20th centuries they began to call themselves Coptic Orthodox in order to distinguish themselves both from Copts who had converted to Roman Catholicism (see also Coptic Catholic Church) and from Eastern Orthodox, who are mostly Greek (see also Greek Orthodox Patriarchate of Alexandria).
In the 4th and 5th centuries a theological conflict arose between the Copts and the Greek-speaking Romans, or Melchites, in Egypt. The Council of Chalcedon (451) rejected monophysite doctrine—the belief that Jesus Christ had only a divine, not a human, nature—and affirmed both his divinity and his humanity. The Melchites recognized the outcome of Chalcedon. The Coptic church, however, became one of the several Eastern churches that rejected the Christological language about the two natures of Christ agreed upon at Chalcedon. Yet while the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches denounced these Eastern churches as monophysite heretics, the Coptic church and other pre-Chalcedonian or (since the 20th century) Oriental Orthodox churches adopted a theological position called miaphysitism. Confessing the statement by St. Cyril of Alexandria (c. 375–444) proclaiming the “one incarnate nature of the Word” of God, miaphysites declared that both Christ’s humanity and divinity were equally present through the Incarnation in one single nature (hence the Greek prefix mia, “same”) as the Word made flesh. Rather than denying Christ’s humanity, as they were accused of doing, the Coptic and other miaphysite churches gave both his humanity and his divinity equal presence in the person of Christ.
After the Arab conquest of Egypt in the 7th century, the Copts ceased speaking Greek, and the language barrier added to the controversy. Various attempts at compromise by the Byzantine emperors came to naught. Later, the Arab caliphs, although they tended to favour those who adopted Islam, did not interfere much in the church’s internal affairs. The jizya, the tax levied upon non-Muslims living in an Islamic state, was abolished in the 18th century.
Arabic is now used in the services of the Coptic Orthodox Church for the lessons from the Bible and for many of the variable hymns; only certain short refrains that churchgoing people all understand are not in Arabic. The service books, using the liturgies attributed to St. Mark, St. Cyril of Alexandria, and St. Gregory of Nazianzus, are written in Coptic (the Bohairic dialect of Alexandria), with the Arabic text in parallel columns.
The Coptic Orthodox Church developed a democratic system of government after the 1890s. The patriarch and the 12 diocesan bishops, with the assistance of community councils in which the laity is well represented, regulate the finances of the churches and schools and the administration of the rules relating to marriage, inheritance, and other matters of personal status. When the patriarch dies, an electoral college, predominantly of laymen, selects three duly qualified monks at least 50 years of age as candidates for the office of patriarch. Among these three, the final choice is made by lot after prayer.
The highest-ranking bishop is the patriarch of Alexandria, who resides in Cairo; he is called the pope and claims apostolic authority for his office from St. Mark. The church has its own primary and secondary schools in many places in Egypt, as well as a strong Sunday-school movement for the religious education of children unable to go to Coptic schools. There is an Institute of Coptic Studies in Cairo, a theological college connected with the institute, and a Coptic museum; the teaching of the Coptic Orthodox Church has even become the basis of the syllabus used in the religious instruction of Christian children in government schools.
There are Coptic Orthodox churches in Jerusalem and in other areas of the Holy Land, built in the 19th and 20th centuries, as well as a Coptic bishopric in Khartoum, Sudan. The church also has a small presence in North America, Australia, and the United Kingdom. The Ethiopian, Armenian, and Syriac Orthodox churches are all Oriental Orthodox churches in communion with the Coptic Orthodox Church. The Oriental Orthodox churches were considered heretical for centuries by the Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox churches. Since the late 20th century, however, the Coptic Orthodox Church, like other Oriental Orthodox churches, has entered into dialogue with both, resolving many theological disputes and garnering recognition as being doctrinally in the mainstream of orthodox Christianity.
