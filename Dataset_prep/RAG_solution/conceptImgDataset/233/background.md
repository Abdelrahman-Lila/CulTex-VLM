Green Island (Arabic: الجزيرة الخضراء) is a small (145 m long x 50 m) artificial island in the Red Sea at the southern mouth of the Suez Canal.

History
Green Island was a fortress built by the British Army (probably by British Troops in Egypt or Rear-Admiral, Alexandria, Royal Navy) to protect the Suez Canal from air and sea attack during World War II. This waterway was of enormous strategic significance for Britain at this time. Located three kilometers south of Port Ibrahim and four kilometers south of the city of Suez and the mouth of the Suez Canal, the fortress was built on a bed of stable corals and made out of reinforced concrete. It consisted of a one-storey building with a large courtyard. At one end of the island, a concrete bridge jutted out into the water toward a circular five-metre-high tower supporting a radar site and two heavy anti-aircraft machine guns. A wall reinforced with thick rows of barbed wire was built at the water's edge, to deter attack from the sea.  Heavy machine guns were emplaced in the roof, and there were over a dozen machine gun nests. A series of concrete bunkers sat atop an 8-foot-high (2.4 m) seawall, ringed by razor wire three rolls deep. There were several gun emplacements.
In 1969, during the War of Attrition between Israel and Egypt, the island was heavily defended. Its garrison consisted of approximately 70 Egyptian infantrymen and 12 special forces commandos, 14 machine gun positions (14.5 mm to 25 mm), two 37 mm anti-aircraft guns, and four 85 mm anti-aircraft guns. On the night of July 19, 1969 the island was raided by Israeli commandos (Operation Bulmus 6). The Egyptian facilities on the island were completely destroyed with Israeli casualties of three Sayeret Matkal and three Shayetet 13 commandos killed, and 11 wounded.

# Britannica:
Green Island, located in the Suez Canal in Egypt, is a small, man-made island
with historical significance. It was constructed in 1929 during the British
occupation of Egypt. The island was originally established as a military
fortification to protect the strategic waterway of the Suez Canal, which is a
crucial maritime route connecting the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea.

### Historical Significance

Green Island played a notable role during the Suez Crisis of 1956. During this
conflict, the island was used as a defensive position by Egyptian forces
against the invading British, French, and Israeli forces. The Suez Crisis was
a pivotal event in the history of the Middle East, marking the decline of
British and French influence in the region and the rise of Egyptian President
Gamal Abdel Nasser as a prominent leader.

### Current Status

Today, Green Island is not as strategically significant as it once was, but it
remains a point of interest due to its historical background. The island is
located near the city of Ismailia, which is one of the major cities along the
Suez Canal. While the island itself is not a major tourist destination, the
Suez Canal and the surrounding areas attract visitors interested in the
canal's history and its vital role in global trade.

Overall, Green Island serves as a reminder of the region's colonial past and
its strategic importance in global maritime navigation.
