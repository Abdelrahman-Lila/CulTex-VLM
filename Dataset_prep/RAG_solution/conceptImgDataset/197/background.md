A Tomb of the Unknown Soldier or Tomb of the Unknown Warrior is a monument dedicated to the services of an unknown soldier and to the common memories of all soldiers killed in war. Such tombs are located in many nations and are usually high-profile national monuments. Throughout history, many soldiers have died in war with their remains being unidentified. Following World War I, a movement arose to commemorate these soldiers with a single tomb, containing the body of one such unidentified soldier.

History
A shrine in Jinju, Korea, which commemorated those who died in defense of Korea during the Imjin War in 1592, has been described as the first Tomb of the Unknown Soldier. It is, however, more inclusive, in that it is a memorial to all who died in defense of the city against the forces of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, civilian as well as soldier. Beginning in 1593, when the Ministry of Rites received permission to perform a sacrifice for all who died in the battle, not only the identifiable bodies, the state offered sacrifices for the dead twice a year in spring and autumn until 1908, when the practice was ended by royal edict.
The first known monument of an unknown soldier in Europe is the Landsoldaten ('Valiant Soldier Square') created in 1849 to commemorate the First Schleswig War, in Fredericia, Denmark.

France and the United Kingdom
During the First World War, the British and French armies who were allies during the war jointly decided to bury soldiers themselves. In the UK, under the Imperial War Graves Commission (now Commonwealth War Graves Commission), the Reverend David Railton had seen a grave marked by a rough cross while serving in the British Army as a chaplain on the Western Front, which bore the pencil-written legend "An Unknown British Soldier".
He suggested (together with the French in their own country) the creation at a national level of a symbolic funeral and burial of an "Unknown Warrior", proposing that the grave should in the UK include a national monument in the form of what is usually, but not in this particular case, a headstone. The idea received the support of the Dean of Westminster, Prime Minister David Lloyd George, and later from King George V, responding to a wave of public support. At the same time, a similar concern grew in France. In November 1916, a local officer of Le Souvenir français proposed the idea of burying "an unknown soldier" in the Panthéon. A formal bill was presented in Parliament in November 1918. The decision was voted into law in September 1919.
The United Kingdom and France conducted services connected with their 'monumental' graves (as presumably newly conceived, and in any case approved, by their respective armies) on Armistice Day 1920 (the burial itself taking place later in January of the following year in France). In the UK, the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior was created at Westminster Abbey, while in France La tombe du soldat inconnu was placed in the Arc de Triomphe.

Other countries
The idea of a symbolic Tomb of the Unknown Soldier then spread to other countries. In 1921, the United States unveiled its own Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, Portugal its Túmulo do Soldado Desconhecido, and Italy its Tomba del Milite Ignoto. Other nations have followed the practice and created their own tombs.
In Chile and Ukraine, the second 'unknown tombs' were unveiled to commemorate The Unknown Sailor.
In Serbia, soldiers of World War I are commemorated by the Monument to the Unknown Hero on the mountain of Avala.
In the Philippines, the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at the Libingan ng mga Bayani ("Cemetery of the Heroes") is the cemetery's most prominent structure.

Symbolism
The Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers typically contain the remains of a soldier who is unidentified (or "known but to God" as the stone is sometimes inscribed). These remains are considered impossible to identify, and so serve as a symbol for all of a country's unknown dead wherever they fell in the war being remembered. The anonymity of the entombed soldier is the key symbolism of the monument; it could be the tomb of anyone who fell in service of the nation, and therefore serves as a monument symbolizing all of the sacrifices.

Identification
Many soldiers have been identified by DNA analysis. The first one to be analyzed was an airman from the Vietnam War.

Examples
Tombs of the Unknown Soldiers from around the world and various wars include the following:

Tomb of the Unknown Soldier,  monumental grave of an unidentifiable military service member who died in wartime. Many countries now maintain such tombs to serve as memorials to all their war dead.
The movement to set aside special tombs for unknown soldiers originated with World War I, a war in which soldiers died in unprecedented numbers. In the United Kingdom the grave of the Unknown Warrior was dedicated on November 11, 1920, the second anniversary of the armistice that ended the war. It is said that the idea for the tomb originated in 1916 with David Railton, an Anglican chaplain serving in France. He later contacted Herbert Ryle, the dean (senior priest) of Westminster Abbey in London, where the tomb eventually was built. Unknown soldiers from several battlefield cemeteries were brought together in one place, where an officer who did not know which was which made the final selection. (The other bodies were reburied elsewhere.) King George V paid his respects at the burial ceremony. France selected its final honoree, the Soldat inconnu  (Unknown Soldier), in much the same way. After a debate over the tomb’s location, with some suggesting the Panthéon, the remains were buried at the base of the Arc de Triomphe in Paris in January 1921.
The United States followed suit shortly afterward. Congress authorized the burial of an unknown soldier on March 4, 1921, and the ceremony took place on November 11, in the plaza of the Memorial Amphitheater at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia, with Pres. Warren G. Harding officiating. The honoree was selected by an army sergeant from among four unknowns who had been exhumed from four American cemeteries in France. The Tomb of the Unknown Soldier site later came to be called the Tomb of the Unknowns as additional unidentified combatants from later wars—World War II, the Korean War, and the Vietnam War—were interred in the shadow of the original sarcophagus. DNA testing during the 1990s revealed that the Vietnam unknown was in fact First Lt. Michael J. Blassie, whose remains were subsequently removed. His empty grave at Arlington was repurposed as a memorial to “Missing Servicemen, 1958–1975.” Some observers think that DNA testing makes it unlikely that future wars will produce unknown soldiers.
Many other countries have created their own unknown soldier monuments. India’s unknown soldier has been interred since 1971 under the India Gate monument in New Delhi. The Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier, near Canberra, Australian Capital Territory, holds a World War I veteran but was not established until 1993. Canada’s unknown soldier is also a World War I casualty, but the monument is even newer, having opened in 2000 at the National War Memorial in Ottawa, Ontario. The Canadian monument was the site of a terrorist attack in October 2014, when a gunman shot and killed one of its honor guards.
