Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church (Coptic: ϯⲉⲕⲕⲗⲏⲥⲓⲁ ⲛ̀ⲧⲉ ⲛⲓ⳥ ⲥⲉⲣⲅⲓⲟⲥ ⲛⲉⲙ ⲃⲁⲭⲟⲥ ϧⲉⲛ ⲡⲓⲥⲡⲉⲗⲉⲱⲛ, The Church of Martyrs Sergius and Bacchus in The Cave) (Arabic: كنيسة القديسين سرجيوس و باخوس (أبو سرجة)), also known as the Abu Serga Church, is one of the oldest Coptic Christian churches in Egypt, dating back to the 4th century.

Importance
The church is of significant historical importance. It is where many patriarchs of the Coptic Church were elected. The first to be elected here was Patriarch Isaac (681-692). It is the episcopal church of Cairo, and it was the episcopal See of Masr (the district of Old Cairo) that replaced the former See of Babylon. Many bishops of the See were consecrated in the Church until the reign of Patriarch Christodulus (1047–1077).
Tradition holds that Saints Sergius and Bacchus Church was built on the spot where the Holy Family (Joseph, Mary and the infant Jesus) rested at the end of their journey into Egypt. They may have lived here while Joseph worked at the Babylon Fortress.

The church
The church is dedicated to Sergius and Bacchus, who were soldier-saints martyred during the 4th century in Syria by the Roman Emperor Maximian.
The most interesting feature is the crypt where Mary, Joseph and the infant Jesus are said to have rested. The crypt is 10 meters deep and, when Nile levels are high, is often flooded. The crypt is over the eastern wall of the canal in Old Cairo.
The Church was built in the 4th century and was probably finished during the 5th century. It was burned during the fire of Fustat during the reign of Marwan II around 750. It was then restored during the 8th century, and has been rebuilt and restored constantly since medieval times; however, it is still considered to be a model of the early Coptic churches. Again, the most precious and ancient of the icons are on the southern wall.

Pope Christodolos
By the 11th century AD, the Seat of the Coptic Orthodox Pope of Alexandria, which is  historically based in Alexandria, Egypt was moved to Cairo as ruling powers moved away from Alexandria to Cairo after the Arab invasion of Egypt and during Pope Christodolos's tenure Cairo became the fixed and official residence of the Coptic Pope at the Hanging Church in Cairo in 1047.
Infighting between the Church of Saints Sergius and Bacchus and the Hanging Church broke out due to that patriarch's wish to be consecrated in the latter, a ceremony that traditionally took place at Saints Sergius and Bacchus.

# Britannica:
Saints Sergius and Bacchus were early Christian martyrs who died around 303 AD
in Risafe, Syria. According to early martyrologies, they were officers in the
Roman army on the Syrian frontier and favorites of Emperor Maximian. However,
they incurred his wrath when they refused to sacrifice to the pagan god
Jupiter because they were Christians. Maximian punished them by demoting them,
dressing them in women’s clothing, and parading them through the streets
before sending them to Risafe, where they were tortured. Bacchus died from
scourging, and Sergius was beheaded after being forced to walk with boards
nailed to his feet.

Posthumously, Sergius and Bacchus received considerable homage. In 431,
Alexander, the metropolitan of Hierapolis, restored the church over Sergius’s
grave, and Risafe later became a bishopric. Emperor Justinian I renamed Risafe
to Sergiopolis, made it an archdiocese, and built churches in Constantinople
and Acre in their honor. The church at Risafe became a major pilgrimage site
in the East, and Sergius and Bacchus were designated protectors of the
Byzantine army, with numerous sanctuaries and churches dedicated to them. They
are venerated, and Sergius is regarded as the patron saint of Christian desert
nomads.

Saints Sergius and Bacchus (died c. 303, Risafe, Syria; feast day October 7) were among the earliest authenticated and most celebrated Christian martyrs, commemorated in the Eastern and Western churches.
Early martyrologies record that Sergius and Bacchus were officers in the Roman army on the Syrian frontier. They were supposedly favourites of the Roman emperor Maximian, whose wrath they incurred by refusing to sacrifice to the pagan god Jupiter because they were Christians. Maximian demoted Sergius and Bacchus, ordering them to be costumed in women’s dress and marched through the streets. They were then sent to Risafe (now a city in ruins in central Syria), where they were scourged so severely that Bacchus died. Boards were nailed to Sergius’s feet, upon which he was forced to walk before being beheaded.
Considerable posthumous homage has been paid the martyrs. In 431 Alexander, metropolitan of Hierapolis, restored the church over Sergius’s grave, and shortly afterward Risafe became a bishopric. The Byzantine emperor Justinian I changed the name of Risafe to Sergiopolis, making it an archdiocese, and in honour of Sergius he had churches built at Constantinople (now Istanbul) and at Acre in Palestine.
The church at Risafe became famous in the East as a major pilgrimage site. Sergius and Bacchus were designated protectors of the Byzantine army, and numerous Eastern sanctuaries and churches were subsequently dedicated to them. Their veneration is old, and a mass ascribed to Pope Gelasius I is assigned to them. Christian desert nomads regard Sergius as their patron saint.
In Same-Sex Unions in Premodern Europe (1994), American professor and historian John Boswell argued that the relationship between Sergius and Bacchus was romantic in nature and represents a type of early Christian same-sex union. Though this controversial claim has been much debated, the saints are popular in the gay Christian community.
