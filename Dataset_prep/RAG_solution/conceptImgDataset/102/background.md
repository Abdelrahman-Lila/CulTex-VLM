# Wikipedia: Mausoleum of Aga Khan
The Mausoleum of Aga Khan is the mausoleum of Aga Khan III (Sir Sultan Muhammed Shah, who died in 1957). The mausoleum is located at Aswan along the Nile of Egypt, since Egypt was formerly the centre of power of the Fatimids, an Ismaili Shia dynasty. It is now also the resting place of Aga Khan IV.
The construction of the mausoleum began in 1956 and ended in 1960. The Aga Khan III's wife, Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan, commissioned the construction of the mausoleum, which initially accepted tourists inside; however, the interior was closed off to the public in 1997.
A red rose is laid on the Aga Khan III's tomb every day – a practice first started by Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan.

Site
The mausoleum sits atop a hill along the west bank of the Nile, where it overlooks Aga Khan III and Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan's villa, the Prince Sadruddin Aga Khan House. The villa was designed by Egyptian architect Hassan Fathy, and it served as a winter home for Aga Khan III, whose will stated that he would be buried near the villa two years after his death.

Architectural style
Architect
Egyptian architect Farid Shafi'e (1907–1985) designed the mausoleum, who during his career served as an architectural designer; professor and director of the architecture department at Cairo University; and consultant for the King Abdulaziz University, among other roles. Among some of the other buildings that Farid Shafie designed during his career are the headquarters of the Royal Navy in Cairo; the Office of the Sheikh at the Al-Azhar Mosque; and a royal suite in the Abdeen Palace in Cairo.
Farid Shafi'e published numerous journal articles and books during his career, including an article about the Masjid al-Juyushi, the Fatimid building that the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III was designed to resemble. Some of Shafi'e's other publications include Characteristics of Decorated Wood in the Abbasid and Fatimid Styles (1954); Arabic Islamic Architecture: Its Past, Present and Future (1981); and Arab Architecture in Islamic Egypt, Volume 2: The Fatimid Era (1982). Shafi'e's past publications indicate that he had studied Fatimid architecture extensively prior to designing the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III.

Stylistic influences
The Mausoleum of Aga Khan III was designed to resemble the Masjid al-Juyushi, a Fatimid mosque and dedicated mausoleum that was constructed in 1085. Both the Masjid al-Juyushi and the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III feature a rectangular layout with high walls, a central dome, and numerous smaller domes. Like the Masjid al-Juyushi, the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III also features an interior mihrab for prayer. Despite numerous functional and aesthetic similarities, the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III does not share some of the Masjid al-Juyushi's most revered features, such as its minaret, its muqarnas cornice, or its courtyard.
Based on aesthetic similarities, the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III's architectural style may have also looked to other examples of Fatimid architecture for inspiration, such as the Aswan Necropolis, a collection of tombs constructed between the 10th and 12th centuries. Both the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III and the Aswan Necropolis feature domes with octagonal transition zones, arched doorways, mihrabs, and building materials that blend in with the surrounding desert environment (the Aswan Necropolis tombs were mostly built with mud brick and coated with lime plaster).
Another Fatimid mausoleum that the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III may have looked to for inspiration is the Mashhad al-Sayyida Ruqayya, which was constructed in Cairo in 1133/527 AH. Like the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III, the Mashhad al-Sayyida Ruqayya features a dome with an octagonal transition zone as well as arched tracery windows with geometric patterns.
Given the many distinct shared features between the Mausoleum of Aga Khan III and various Fatimid mausoleums, it can be understood that the design of Aga Khan's mausoleum was largely influenced by Fatimid architecture.

Exterior design
The Mausoleum of Aga Khan III is built of pink limestone. Crenellated parapets line the outer wall, and an arched doorway on the western side of mausoleum serves as the only entrance to the mausoleum's interior. The eastern side of the mausoleum features a large central dome with arched tracery windows along the octagonal drum. Four miniature domes are located on each corner of the outer wall.

Interior design
Quran'ic inscriptions adorn the interior tomb of Aga Khan III, which is made of Carrara marble. The mausoleum's floor plan indicates that the tomb faces a mihrab, which is located under the central dome on the eastern wall of the mausoleum.

Burial of Aga Khan III
Aga Khan III was reburied in the mausoleum on 20 February 1959, two years after his death and first burial in Switzerland. Those in attendance included Aga Khan IV, Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan, and over 2,000 other guests. Begum Om Habibeh Aga Khan died in 2000 before being buried in the mausoleum neighboring that of her husband.

Burial of Aga Khan IV
Aga Khan IV was buried in the mausoleum on 9 February 2025, following his death five days earlier in Lisbon, Portugal.

The Mausoleum of the Aga Khan, located in Aswan, Egypt, is a popular monument
known for its simple architectural beauty and the love story behind its
construction. Aga Khan III chose the site as his final resting place three
years before his death in 1957.

### Architecture and Design

The mausoleum is a small, square building with turrets at its corners and a
fanned staircase leading to the entrance. Inside, a tomb carved from white
Carrara marble rests under a domed structure. The pink granite structure
appears to glow at sunset. Princess Yvonne Aga Khan, his French-born wife,
known as the Begum, built the mausoleum after consulting with a British
professor of Islamic architecture and drawing inspiration from Cairo’s Fatmid
Giushi mosque and its _mihrab_. She also chose a young architect, Fareed El-
Shafei. The mausoleum was completed in 1959, and Aga Khan III was buried there
16 months later.

### Significance

The Aga Khan III held a position of high esteem in the Islamic world. After
his death, the Begum stayed at her nearby house for six months each year,
placing a rose on her husband’s tomb daily until her death in 2000. The title
of Aga Khan was bestowed in 1818 on the 46th imam of the Nizāri Ismāʿīlīs by
the Persian Qājār king Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh. The Aga Khan I claimed direct descent
of his imamate from ʿAlī, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, and ʿAlī’s
wife Fāṭimah, Muhammad’s daughter.

Aga Khan IV (born December 13, 1936, Geneva, Switzerland—died February 4, 2025, Lisbon, Portugal) was the wealthy and worldly spiritual leader of the Nizārī Ismāʿīlī sect from his appointment as the 49th imam in the sect in 1957, following the death of his grandfather, the Aga Khan III, until his death in 2025. Simultaneously an entrepreneur and a strong religious community leader, the Aga Khan IV amassed a fortune while pursuing various philanthropic efforts to benefit his community and people in the developing world. For the Aga Khan IV, the practice of Islam necessarily combined spirituality with everyday life. A citizen of Britain, France, Switzerland, and Portugal (and an honorary Canadian), he was also a global leader in his business and development ventures as well as his guidance of the diaspora Ismāʿīlī community. After his death he was succeeded by his son Rahim, who became the Aga Khan V.
The title of “Aga Khan” was bestowed in 1818 on the 46th imam of the Nizārī Ismāʿīlīs—a branch of the Ismāʿīliyyah sect of Shiʿi Islam—by the Persian Qājār king Fatḥ ʿAlī Shāh. The honorific title, also anglicized as “Agha Khan,” combines words of Turkic origin meaning “master” or “lord.” The Aga Khan I (Ḥasan ʿAlī Shāh) claimed direct descent of his imamate from ʿAlī, the son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, and ʿAlī’s wife Fāṭimah, Muhammad’s daughter. The Aga Khan I led an unsuccessful attempt at overthrowing the Qājār dynasty and fled to India. His son, the Aga Khan II, had a short-lived imamate, but his son the Aga Khan III, was a charismatic and progressive leader of the Ismāʿīliyyah Muslim community in India and beyond. The Aga Khan III’s reform-minded approach to social issues and cohesive leadership of his community paved the way for the Aga Khan IV.
The Aga Khan IV was the elder son of Aga Khan III’s son Aly Khan and his first wife, Joan Yarde-Buller, the daughter of the 3rd Baron Churston. (Aly later divorced his first wife and married American actor Rita Hayworth.) He was born in Switzerland, as Karim al-Husseini, and much of his upbringing was in Nairobi, Kenya, which hosts a small but influential Ismāʿīliyyah community of emigrants from India. The Aga Khan IV was educated in Switzerland and at Harvard University. In 1957, while still a student at Harvard and only 20 years of age, his grandfather chose him as successor to the imamate, bypassing Aly. The Aga Khan III explained the unusual decision to skip a generation in his will, as printed in the Aga Khan IV’s obituary in The Times of London in 2025:
The Aga Khan IV graduated from Harvard with a bachelor’s degree in Islamic history in 1959 and had plans to pursue a doctorate in history, but his appointment as imam shifted his plans. In an interview in 1964 with Sports Illustrated, he reflected, “Overnight my whole life changed completely. I woke up with serious responsibilities toward millions of other human beings.” In 1957, after he became imam, Queen Elizabeth bestowed on him the title “His Highness.” The Aga Khan IV initiated visits to his scattered Ismāʿīlī peoples in the first year of his reign. He became a strong leader of the approximately 15 million Ismāʿīlīs worldwide and ordered his followers to become citizens of the countries in which they resided and to leave countries where they faced trouble and persecution. In 1986 he spearheaded the adoption of a constitution that established an administrative structure for the global diaspora. As imam, he had the responsibility of interpreting Islam for his followers, but he was also concerned about the perception of Islam in the rest of the world and about Islam’s internal variety—matters he thought were important to understand for the promotion of religious pluralism. In 2015 he established a global seat of the Ismāʿīlī imamate in Portugal.
The Aga Khan IV was known for his business acumen, and his extensive private holdings included hotels, airlines, and newspapers. Many of his business endeavors were in Central Asia and Africa. His fortune was estimated by Forbes in 2008 to be $1 billion, though later estimates were as high as $13 billion. Such wealth derived from his companies as well as tithes from the Ismāʿīlī community. As for his combination of commerce and Islam, he told Vanity Fair in a 2013 interview, “An Imam is not expected to withdraw from everyday life. On the contrary, he’s expected to protect his community and contribute to their quality of life.”
On a personal level, the Aga Khan was known for his Westernized clothes, jet-setter lifestyle, and interest in sports. He competed in downhill skiing on behalf of Iran (prior to the Iranian Revolution) at the Innsbruck 1964 Olympic Games. He also continued his family’s extensive horse-breeding and training enterprise. Among his business ventures was a yachting resort in Sardinia. The Aga Khan IV was married twice, first to Sarah Croker Poole in 1969 and, following their divorce in 1995, to Gabriele zu Leiningen in 1995, a marriage that ended in divorce in 2014. He chose his son Rahim, born to Poole in 1971, to succeed him as the Aga Khan V, the 50th Ismāʿīlī imam.
Through organizations such as the Aga Khan Foundation, the imamate of the Aga Khan IV funded aid agencies offering educational, health, and housing services in South Asia and East Africa. In 1977 he established the Institute for Ismaili Studies to support academic study of Shiʿi and Ismāʿīlī history, religion, and culture. He also founded the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN), an umbrella organization for nine subsidiary organizations that promote education, the arts, health, and development. Within that group, the Aga Khan Fund for Economic Development (AKFED) invests in development programs to promote manufacturing, tourism, and financial services in the developing world. By the early 2020s the for-profit development group had boasted $4 billion in revenue that was reinvested in its worldwide affiliate companies.
