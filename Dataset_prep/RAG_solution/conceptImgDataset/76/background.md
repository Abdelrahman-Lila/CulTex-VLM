Meidum, Maydum or Maidum (Arabic: ميدوم, Ancient Egyptian: Mr(y)-Jtmw, lit. 'beloved of Atum', Ancient Greek: Μοι(ε)θυμις) is an archaeological site in Lower Egypt. It contains a large pyramid and several mudbrick mastabas. The pyramid was Egypt's first straight-sided one, but it partially collapsed in ancient times.  The area is located around 72 kilometres (45 mi) south of modern Cairo.

Pyramid
The pyramid at Meidum is thought to be just the second pyramid of four built by Sneferu after Djoser's and may have been originally built for Huni, the last pharaoh of the Third Dynasty, and continued by Sneferu. Because of its unusual appearance, the pyramid is called el-heram el-kaddaab (false pyramid) in Egyptian Arabic.
The pyramid was erected in three phases, numbered E1, E2 and E3 by the archaeologist Borchardt. E1 was a step pyramid similar to the Djoser Pyramid. E2 was an extension around the previous building of roughly 5 m width or 10 cubits, raising the number of steps from 5 to 7.   
The second extension E3 turned the original step pyramid design into a true pyramid by filling in the steps with limestone encasing. While this approach is consistent with the design of the other true pyramids, Meidum was affected by construction errors. Firstly, the outer layer was founded on sand and not on rock, like the inner layers. Secondly, the inner step pyramids had been designed as the final stage. Thus, the outer surface was polished and the platforms of the steps were not horizontal, but fell off to the outside. This severely compromised the stability and is likely to have caused the collapse of the Meidum Pyramid in a downpour while the building was still under construction.

Franck Monnier and others believe the pyramid did not collapse until the New Kingdom, but there are a number of facts contradicting this theory. The Meidum Pyramid seems never to have been completed. Beginning with Sneferu and to the 12th Dynasty, all pyramids had a valley temple, which is missing at Meidum. The mortuary temple, which was found under the rubble at the base of the pyramid, apparently never was finished. Walls were only partly polished. Two stelas inside, usually bearing the names of the pharaoh, are missing inscriptions. The burial chamber inside the pyramid itself is uncompleted, with raw walls and wooden supports still in place which are usually removed after construction. Affiliated mastabas were never used or completed and none of the usual burials have been found. Finally, the first examinations of the Meidum Pyramid found everything below the surface of the rubble mound fully intact. Stones from the outer cover were stolen only after they were exposed by the excavations. This makes a catastrophic collapse more probable than a gradual one. The collapse of this pyramid during the reign of Sneferu is the likely reason for the change from 54 to 43 degrees of his second pyramid at Dahshur, the Bent Pyramid.
By the time it was investigated by Napoleon's Expedition in 1799, the Meidum Pyramid had its present three steps. It is commonly assumed the pyramid still had five steps in the fifteenth century and was gradually falling further into ruin, because al-Maqrizi described it as looking like a five-stepped mountain, but Mendelssohn claimed this might be the result of a loose translation and al-Makrizi's words would more accurately translate into "five-storied mountain", a description which could even match the present state of the pyramid with four bands of different masonry at the base and a step on top.
The particular nature of the Meidum Pyramid building phases allows conclusions on the building process and the used ramp system.  The pyramid extensions E2 and E3 both were ring-shaped extensions only 5 m wide around the previous building core in full building height. Even the mass volume was relatively small compared with complete pyramids, the building site required a full ramp system and had to be volume-saving and cost-effective (otherwise E2 would not have been repeated in E3) which applies for tangential ramps of 10 cubits or 5m width . Another observation are the "ramp prints", recesses in the wall at the eastern wall of the exposed third and fourth step of E2, showing a possible joint to a ramp of almost 5 m width with steep side slopes. The recesses were described by Borchardt and are still visible, best in morning light. Borchardt´s interpretation as a trace of a straight long ramp is widely rejected and contradicted by the fact the recess at the third step is narrower than that of the fourth. More realistic would be a joint to tangential ramps integrated to the E2 steps.

Excavations
The Meidum Pyramid  was excavated by John Shae Perring in 1837, Lepsius in 1843 and then by Flinders Petrie later in the nineteenth century, who located the mortuary temple, facing to the east. In 1920 Ludwig Borchardt studied the area further, followed by Alan Rowe in 1928 and then Ali el-Kholi in the 1970s.
In its ruined state, the structure is 213 feet (65 meters) high, and its entrance is aligned north-south, with the entrance in the north, 66 feet (20 meters) above present ground level. The steep descending passage 57 feet (17 meters) long leads to a horizontal passage, just below the original ground level, that then leads to a vertical shaft 10 feet (3.0 meters) high that leads to the corbelled burial chamber itself. The chamber is unlikely to have been used for any burial.
Flinders Petrie was the first Egyptologist to establish the facts of its original design dimensions and proportions. In its final form it was 1100 cubits of 0.523 m around by 175 cubits high, thus showing the same proportions as the Great Pyramid at Giza, and therefore the same circular symbolism. Petrie wrote in the 1892 excavation report  that "We see then that there is an exactly analogous theory for the dimensions of Medum [sic] to that of the Great Pyramid; in each the approximate ratio of 7:44 is adopted, as referred to the radius and circle ..." These proportions equated to the four outer faces sloping in by precisely 51.842° or 51°50'35", which would have been understood and expressed by the Ancient Egyptians as a seked slope of 51⁄2 palms.

The term "medium" can refer to different concepts depending on the context:

## Maydūm

Maydūm is an ancient Egyptian site located near Memphis, on the west bank of
the Nile River. It contains the earliest known pyramid complex, which includes
the pyramid itself, a mortuary temple, and a causeway leading to a valley
temple near the Nile. The Maydūm pyramid was initially built as a seven-
stepped pyramid, with an additional step added later. The steps were filled in
and covered with fine Tura limestone to give it the appearance of a true
pyramid. Scholars believe that the pyramid's construction was started by Huni,
the last king of the 3rd dynasty, and completed by his successor, Snefru, the
first king of the 4th dynasty. The outer casing and fill of the pyramid began
to collapse during reconstruction under Snefru, leading to the abandonment of
the work and leaving the mortuary chapel uninscribed. This collapse resulted
in the pyramid's current appearance.

## Medium in Occultism

In occultism, a medium is a person who is believed to be able to communicate
with spirits, especially while in a trance. Spiritualist mediums play a
central role in séances and may require the assistance of a "control," an
invisible go-between. During a séance, disembodied voices may speak directly
or through the medium. It is alleged that spirits or body parts can
materialize from a viscous substance called ectoplasm, which comes from the
medium's body and then disappears. Sometimes, the medium or an object may
appear to float in the air, which is known as levitation.

## Medium in Art

In painting, mediums are the liquids that are added to paints to bind them and
make them workable. In a broader sense, the term includes all the paints,
tools, supports, surfaces, and techniques used by painters. Paints are made
from colored pigment, ground into a fine powder. The vehicle used to bind and
thin the pigment, the preparation of the surface, and the tools and techniques
used determine the expressive capacities and final surface texture of each
medium.

## Medium as a Publishing Platform

Medium is a publishing platform founded in 2012 by Evan Williams, who also co-
founded Twitter. Williams described Medium as a "place for ideas and stories,"
with many submissions coming from users.



## Britannica: Maydūm | Old Kingdom, Pyramid, Mortuary Temple | Britannica
Maydūm,  ancient Egyptian site near Memphis on the west bank of the Nile River in Banī Suwayf muḥāfaẓah (governorate). It is the location of the earliest-known pyramid complex with all the parts of a normal Old Kingdom (c. 2575–c. 2130 bc) funerary monument. These parts included the pyramid itself, a mortuary temple, and a sloping causeway leading to a valley temple built near the Nile. The Maydūm pyramid was originally a seven-stepped pyramid to which another step was added. Finally, the steps were filled in, and the entire structure was overlaid with fine Tura limestone, giving it the appearance of a true pyramid. Most scholars agree that the pyramid was probably begun by Huni, the last king of the 3rd dynasty (c. 2650–c. 2575), but was apparently completed by his successor, Snefru, the first king of the 4th dynasty (c. 2575–c. 2465). Late in its reconstruction under Snefru, the outer casing and fill of the pyramid began to collapse. The work was abandoned, and the mortuary chapel remained uninscribed. The collapse produced the present appearance of the pyramid.

medium,   in occultism, a person reputedly able to make contact with the world of spirits, especially while in a state of trance. A spiritualist medium is the central figure during a séance (q.v.) and sometimes requires the assistance of an invisible go-between, or control. During a séance, disembodied voices are said to speak, either directly or through the medium. Materialization of a disembodied spirit or of a specific part of a human body can allegedly take shape from a mysterious, viscous substance called ectoplasm that exudes from the medium’s body and subsequently disappears by returning to its original source. At times the medium, or a material object, appears to float in the air (levitation).

## Britannica: Painting - Watercolour Techniques, Pigments, History | Britannica
Watercolors are pigments ground with gum arabic and gall and thinned with water in use. Sable and squirrel (“camel”) hair brushes are used on white or tinted paper and card.
Three hundred years before the late 18th-century English watercolorists, German artist Albrecht Dürer anticipated their technique of transparent color washes in a remarkable series of plant studies and panoramic landscapes. Until the emergence of the English school, however, watercolor became a medium merely for color tinting outlined drawings or, combined with opaque body color to produce effects similar to gouache or tempera, was used in preparatory studies for oil paintings.
The chief exponents of the English method were Thomas Girtin, John Sell Cotman, John Robert Cozens, Richard Parkes Bonington, David Cox, and Constable. Turner, however, true to his unorthodox approaches, added white to his watercolor and used rags, sponges, and knives to obtain unique effects of light and texture. Victorian watercolorists, such as Birket Foster, used a laborious method of color washing a monochrome underpainting, similar in principle to the tempera-oil technique. Following the direct, vigorous watercolors of the French Impressionists and Post-Impressionists, however, the medium was established in Europe and America as an expressive picture medium in its own right. Notable 20th-century watercolorists were Wassily Kandinsky, Paul Klee, Raoul Dufy, and Georges Rouault; the American artists Winslow Homer, Thomas Eakins, Maurice Prendergast, Charles Burchfield, John Marin, Lyonel Feininger, Rhoda Holmes Nicholls, and Jim Dine; the English painters John and Paul Nash; and the Swedish artist Hilma af Klint.
In the “pure” watercolor technique, often referred to as the English method, no white or other opaque pigment is applied, color intensity and tonal depth being built up by successive, transparent washes on damp paper. Patches of white paper are left unpainted to represent white objects and to create effects of reflected light. These flecks of bare paper produce the sparkle characteristic of pure watercolor. Tonal gradations and soft, atmospheric qualities are rendered by staining the paper when it is very wet with varying proportions of pigment. Sharp accents, lines, and coarse textures are introduced when the paper has dried. The paper should be of the type sold as “handmade from rags”; this is generally thick and grained. Cockling is avoided when the surface dries out if the dampened paper has been first stretched across a special frame or held in position during painting by an edging of tape.
Ink is the traditional painting medium of China and Japan, where it has been used with long-haired brushes of wolf, goat, or badger on silk or absorbent paper. Asian black ink is a gum-bound carbon stick that is ground on rough stone and mixed with varying amounts of water to create a wide range of modulated tones or applied almost dry, with lightly brushed strokes, to produce coarser textures. The calligraphic brush technique is expressive of Zen Buddhist and Confucian philosophies, brush-stroke formulas for the spiritual interpretation of nature in painting dictating the use of the lifted brush tip for the “bone,” or “lean,” structure of things and the spreading belly of the hairs for their “flesh,” or “fat,” volumes. The East Asian artist poises the brush vertically above the paper and controls its rhythmic movements from the shoulder. Distant forms represented in landscapes painted on silk were sometimes brushed on from the reverse side.
In the Western world, ink has been used rather more for preparatory studies and topographical and literary illustrations than as a medium for easel paintings. Western artists have generally combined ink washes with contours and textures in quill or steel pen. Among the finest of these are by Rembrandt, Nicolas Poussin, Francisco Goya, Samuel Palmer, Constable, and Édouard Manet. Claude Lorrain, Turner, Daumier, Braque, Picasso, Reginald Marsh, Henri Michaux, John Piper, Margaret Neilson Armstrong, and Qin Feng are some of those who have exploited its unique qualities. Contemporary artists also use markers as well as ballpoint and felt pens.
Gouache is opaque watercolor, known also as poster paint and designer’s color. It is thinned with water for applying, with sable- and hog-hair brushes, to white or tinted paper and card and, occasionally, to silk. Honey, starch, or acrylic is sometimes added to slacken its quick-drying property. Liquid glue is preferred as a thinner by painters wishing to retain the tonality of colors (which otherwise dry slightly lighter in key) and to prevent thick paint from flaking. Gouache paints have the advantages that they dry out almost immediately to a matte finish and, if required, without visible brush marks. These qualities, with the capacities to be washed thinly or applied in thick impasto and a wide color range that now includes fluorescent and metallic pigments, make the medium particularly suited to preparatory studies for oil and acrylic paintings. It is the medium that produces the suede finish and crisp lines characteristic of many Indian and Islamic miniatures, and it has been used in Western screen and fan decoration and by artists such as Rouault, Klee, Jean Dubuffet, Morris Graves, Jacob Lawrence, Laylah Ali, and Amy Sherald.
Encaustic painting (from the Greek: “burnt in”) was the ancient method, recorded by Pliny, of fixing pigments with heated wax. It was probably first practiced in Egypt about 3000 bce and is thought to have reached its peak in Classical Greece, although no examples from that period survive. Pigments, mixed with melted beeswax, were brushed onto stone or plaster, smoothed with a metal spatula, and then blended and driven into the wall with a heated iron. The surface was later polished with a cloth. Leonardo and others attempted unsuccessfully to revive the technique. North American Indians used an encaustic method whereby pigments mixed with hot animal fat were pressed into a design engraved on smoothed buffalo hide.
A simplified encaustic technique uses a spatula to apply wax mixed with solvent and pigment to wood or canvas, producing a ridged, impasto surface. This is an ancient and most durable medium. Coptic mummy portraits from the 1st and 2nd centuries ce retain the softly blended, translucent coloring typical of waxwork effigies. In the 19th century Vincent van Gogh also used this method to give body to his oil pigment; the Neo-Impressionist artist Louis Hayet applied encaustic to paper, and it was used by American painter Jasper Johns for his iconic paintings of maps, targets, and flags. Colored wax crayons have also been used by modern painters such as Picasso, Klee, Arshile Gorky, and Hockney.
Casein, or “cheese painting,” is a medium in which pigments are tempered with the gluey curd of cheese or milk precipitate. For handling, an emulsion of casein and lime is thinned with water. The active element of casein contains nitrogen, which forms a soluble caseate of calcium in the presence of lime. It is applied in thin washes to rigid surfaces, such as cardboard, wood, and plastered walls.
Casein colors dry quickly, although lighter in tone than when first applied. Since they have more body than egg-tempera paints, they can be applied with bristle brushes to create impasto textures not unlike those of oils. Casein paints were used in ancient Rome. They are now available ready-made in tubes and have been used by such modern artists as Robert Motherwell and Claes Oldenburg.
Casein is also an ingredient of some charcoal and pastel fixatives and was a traditional primer for walls and panels.

## Britannica: Evan Williams | Biography, Twitter, Medium, & Facts | Britannica
Evan Williams (born March 31, 1972, near Clarks, Nebraska, U.S.) is an American computer programmer who, with Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone, founded Twitter, an online microblogging service.
Williams grew up on a farm but had aspirations of starting his own business, and he left the University of Nebraska at Lincoln without graduating. In the mid-1990s he briefly ran a company that he and his father set up to provide instructional material about the World Wide Web. He then worked as a Web developer for several California-based computer companies before cofounding (1999) Pyra Labs to make project-management software. While he was with Pyra Labs, Williams developed—with Stone—a software tool for publishing personal commentary on the Web. The software, which he called Blogger, formed the basis of the wave of Web logs, or blogs, that soon swelled over the Internet. The new company that Williams had formed, Blogger.com, was bought in 2003 by Google.
Williams left Google in 2004 and became a cofounder of Odeo, a podcasting company. Stone joined Odeo in 2005. The following year the men were approached by Dorsey, a software engineer, with the idea of using text messaging and instant messaging (based on the principles of dispatch software) as a way of keeping in touch with friends. Together they developed a prototype of what would become the Twitter platform. Twitter was launched in 2006, and the trio formed a new parent company, Obvious, that acquired Odeo and then spun off Twitter, Inc., as a separate entity in 2007. Over the next several years, the service became a highly popular means of communication, adopted and endorsed by celebrities, news outlets, and corporations.
Williams was initially chairman of the board of Twitter, but he moved to the role of CEO in late 2008; however, he continued to be a board member. In 2010 he stepped down as CEO to concentrate on product strategy, and in 2019 he gave up his seat on the board.
During this time Williams was involved in other ventures, notably Medium, which he founded in 2012. He described the publishing platform as a “place for ideas and stories,” many of which were submitted by users.
