Antoniadis Palace is a historical mansion located in Alexandria, Egypt. It is
renowned for its architectural beauty and its surrounding gardens. The palace
was built in the late 19th century by Sir John Antoniadis, a wealthy Greek
cotton magnate. The design of the palace reflects a blend of neoclassical and
European architectural styles, which were popular among affluent families in
Alexandria during that period.

The Antoniadis Gardens, which surround the palace, are also a significant
attraction. These gardens are among the oldest in Alexandria and feature a
variety of plant species, statues, and fountains, making them a popular spot
for both tourists and locals. The gardens are often used for cultural events
and provide a serene escape from the bustling city.

Over the years, the palace and its gardens have served various purposes,
including hosting official events and accommodating dignitaries. While the
Antoniadis Palace remains a symbol of Alexandria's rich cultural heritage,
efforts have been made to preserve and restore the site to maintain its
historical significance.
