New Kalabsha is a promontory located near Aswan in Egypt.
Created during the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia, it houses several important temples, structures, and other remains that have been relocated here from the site of Old Kalabsha (Arabic: باب الكلابشة Bāb al-Kalābsha, "Gate of Kalabsha", Ancient Greek: Ταλμις Talmis) and other sites in Lower Nubia, to avoid the rising waters of Lake Nasser caused by the construction of the Aswan High Dam. The major remains are described below:

Kalabsha Temple
The Temple of Kalabsha (or Temple of Mandulis) is the major structure in New Kalabsha. The entire Roman period temple to the sun god Mandulis was relocated here in 1970. It was built by Emperor Augustus and was the largest free-standing temple of Egyptian Nubia. During relocation, the temple was cut into 13,000 blocks.

Gerf Hussein
The temple of Gerf Hussein (originally known as Per Ptah, the "House of Ptah") is dedicated to Ramesses II and was built by the Viceroy of Nubia Setau. Originally, it was partially free-standing and partially rock-cut. During the flooding of Lake Nasser, the free-standing section was dismantled and then rebuilt at New Kalabsha. Most of the rock-cut temple was left in place and is now submerged beneath the waters.

Beit el-Wali
The rock-cut temple of Beit el-Wali was moved from its original location by a Polish archaeological team. It is dedicated to Ramesses II, and the gods of Amun and Anukis (among others). It was originally decorated in bright colors, but these were mostly removed by a "squeeze" taken in the 19th century (the results of this squeeze are now on display in the British Museum).

Kiosk of Qertassi
The Kiosk of Qertassi is "a tiny Roman kiosk with four slender papyrus columns inside [and] two Hathor columns at the entrance." It is a small but elegant structure that "is unfinished and not inscribed with the name of the architect, but is probably contemporary with Trajan's Kiosk at Philae."

Dedwen
Originally located within the outer wall of the temple of Kalabsha, and is dedicated to the Nubian serpent god, Dedwen. It was moved along with the Kalabsha temple to New Kalabsha.

New Kalabsha is the current location of the large Egypto-Roman temple of
Kalabsha, which was moved about 30 miles (50 km) from its original location.
The relocation of the temple of Kalabsha, along with fifteen other temples in
Egyptian Nubia, was part of a UNESCO-led effort to salvage ancient sites and
monuments threatened by the construction of the Aswan High Dam.

World Heritage site,  any of various areas or objects inscribed on the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) World Heritage List. The sites are designated as having “outstanding universal value” under the Convention Concerning the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage. This document was adopted by UNESCO in 1972 and formally took effect in 1975 after having been ratified by 20 countries. It provides a framework for international cooperation in preserving and protecting cultural treasures and natural areas throughout the world.
There are three types of sites: cultural, natural, and mixed. Cultural heritage sites include hundreds of historic buildings and town sites, important archaeological sites, and works of monumental sculpture or painting. Natural heritage sites are restricted to those natural areas that (1) furnish outstanding examples of Earth’s record of life or its geologic processes, (2) provide excellent examples of ongoing ecological and biological evolutionary processes, (3) contain natural phenomena that are rare, unique, superlative, or of outstanding beauty, or (4) furnish habitats for rare or endangered animals or plants or are sites of exceptional biodiversity. Mixed heritage sites contain elements of both natural and cultural significance. The ratio of cultural to natural sites on the World Heritage List is roughly 3 to 1. Several new sites are added to the list at the middle of each year (until 2002, sites were added in December).
The primary impetus for the adoption of the World Heritage Convention was the construction of the Aswan High Dam. In 1959 the governments of the United Arab Republic (U.A.R.; now Egypt and Syria) and Sudan turned to UNESCO for help in salvaging the ancient sites and monuments of Egyptian Nubia. The sites were threatened with destruction by the great lake which would build up behind the new dam at Aswān. UNESCO responded with an appeal to the international community for assistance, and the result was the largest archaeological rescue operation in history.
Aerial archaeological surveys were carried out by UNESCO in collaboration with the governments of the U.A.R. and Sudan in 1960. The UNESCO mission in Sudan, while assisting the national expeditions in providing survey data and a photographic laboratory at Wādī Ḥalfā, made ground surveys of the many islands of the Second Cataract and of sections of the east and west banks of the Nile River. In addition, the mission recorded and excavated a considerable number of sites. An Old Kingdom town was discovered at Buhen, providing evidence of a much earlier Egyptian penetration of Kush than was previously believed. The town was preserved and relocated. A chain of Middle Kingdom mud brick fortresses near the Second Cataract received well-merited attention but could not be salvaged, because of the nature of their construction. Expeditions uncovered rich remains of Nubian A Group and C Group people, in the shape of cemeteries and even houses, and much was added to the knowledge of these historically significant cultures. Explorations at Qaṣr Ibrīm yielded a splendid array of bronze vessels, glassware, ornaments, and iron weapons, as well as large numbers of early manuscripts in Old Nubian, Coptic, and Arabic. A spectacular find was made in the great basilica hidden beneath the mound at Faras West (Pachoras) where excavators removed and restored over 100 remarkable frescoes.
While these efforts represented a remarkable international undertaking, the preservation and relocation of the temples of Nubia posed a challenge of a much greater magnitude. UNESCO’s Executive Committee of the International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia undertook a massive fund-raising effort, and so generous was the world’s response that virtually all the significant temples and shrines of Nubia were preserved. The salvaging of the two rock-cut temples, of Ramses II and Queen Nefertari, at Abu Simbel, posed unprecedented problems. The plan—to remove the overlying sandstone, dissect the temples in the interior of the cliff, and reassemble them on a prepared site on the plateau above—was successfully carried out by late 1967. Covering the temples were concrete domes which in turn would be buried under artificial hills that would reproduce as far as possible the landscape of the original setting.
Fifteen other temples were salvaged in Egyptian Nubia, including the large Egypto-Roman temple of Kalabsha, which now stands some 30 miles (50 km) from the place of its foundation. All three 18th-dynasty temples of Sudanese Nubia—Semna East, Semna West, and Buhen—were re-erected on the grounds of the new archaeological museum in Khartoum. The removal of Hatshepsut’s temple at Buhen exposed, for the first time in 3,500 years, the foundations of the original Middle Kingdom temple beneath. A group of Ptolemaic-Roman temples on the island of Philae, downstream of the high dam, were relocated to the nearby island of Agilkia in the 1970s.
