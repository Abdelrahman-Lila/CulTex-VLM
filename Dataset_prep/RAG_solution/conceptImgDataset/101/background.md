Al-Jazīrah (Gezira) is a region in central-southeast Sudan that lies southeast
of the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers. The Gezira Scheme, one of
the world's largest irrigation projects, began in 1925 by the British. It
distributes water from the Blue Nile through a network of canals to irrigate
fields for cotton and other cash crops, making Al-Jazīrah the most productive
agricultural area of Sudan.

Most of the population in the region engages in agriculture, growing crops
such as cotton, cereals, oilseeds, peanuts, wheat, sesame, sorghum, millet,
and vegetables. Industries in the area produce ginned cotton, sesame and
peanut oils, cigarettes, leather goods, soap, and processed foods. Wad Madani
is Al-Jazīrah's chief city.

The Gezira Scheme, situated on a fertile clay plain between the White and Blue
Niles south of Khartoum, covers 2.5 million acres and provides water to over
100,000 tenant farmers. These tenants cooperate with the government and the
Sudan Gezira Board in farming the land.

Al-Jazīrah,  region, central-southeast Sudan. Al-Jazīrah lies just southeast of the confluence of the Blue and White Nile rivers; the Blue Nile runs northwestward through the central part of the region, and the White Nile lies to the west. The Blue Nile is joined by the Dinder River at the southern border of Al-Jazīrah and is joined by the Rahad River east of Wad Madani.
Al-Jazīrah is the site of one of the largest irrigation projects in the world. Begun by the British in 1925, the Jazīrah (Gezira) scheme distributes the waters of the Blue Nile through a 2,700-mile (4,300-km) network of canals and ditches to irrigate fields growing cotton and other cash crops. This scheme has made Al-Jazīrah the most productive agricultural area of Sudan. Water for the scheme is supplied from the Sennar and Al-Ruṣayriṣ dams upstream on the Blue Nile.
Most of the population engages in agriculture, and crops include cotton, cereals, oilseeds, peanuts (groundnuts), wheat, sesame, durra (sorghum), dukhn (millet), and vegetables. A hydroelectric plant is located at Wad Madani. Industries produce ginned cotton, sesame and peanut oils, cigarettes, leather goods, soap, and processed foods. Wad Madani is the chief city of Al-Jazīrah. Most of the people are Arabs; the Nuba are the only significant minority.

Sudan’s main crops include cotton, peanuts (groundnuts), sesame, gum arabic, sorghum, and sugarcane. The main subsistence crops are sorghum and millet, with smaller amounts of wheat, corn, and barley. There are four distinct subsectors in Sudanese agriculture: modern irrigated farming, most of which is carried out with mechanized equipment on a large scale with the help of government investment; mechanized rain-fed crop production; traditional rain-fed farming; and livestock raising.
Irrigated areas along the White and Blue Niles produce the bulk of the country’s commercial crops. These areas are centred on the Gezira Scheme (Al-Jazīrah)—with its Mangil extension—between the Blue and White Niles south of Khartoum. Other major farming areas are watered by the Khashm Al-Qirbah Dam on the Atbara River and by Al-Ruṣayriṣ Dam, which provides irrigation water for the Rahad Scheme.
Sudan’s irrigated agriculture is thus dependent on abundant supplies of water from the two main branches of the Nile. The future growth of Sudanese agriculture, however, continues to depend on mechanized rain-fed farming in a broad belt running from the northeastern portion of the country to the south-southwest. Mechanized rain-fed farming was begun in the fertile clay plains of eastern Sudan in the mid-1940s and has since greatly expanded. One of the major disadvantages of this type of agriculture, however, is that rich farmers practice a sophisticated version of traditional shifting cultivation: they farm an area intensively with government-financed equipment for a few years but then move on to more attractive virgin land when yields decline. This practice has led to soil erosion and even to desertification in some areas. Despite these problems, the broad belt of mechanized farms in the east stretching from the Atbara River west to the Blue Nile is now the granary of the country, with sorghum, sesame, and cereal grains as its main crops.
Because of the relative anarchy of the mechanized rain-fed sector in agriculture, planners in Sudan have tended to concentrate their efforts on irrigation schemes, under which cotton is the dominant crop. The bulk of the cotton crop is grown on the Gezira Scheme, situated on a fertile wedge-shaped clay plain lying between the White and Blue Niles south of Khartoum. The scheme, which was begun by the British in 1925 to provide cotton for the textile mills of Lancashire, Eng., is one of the largest irrigation projects for agriculture in the world. It covers an area of 2.5 million acres (1 million hectares) and provides water for more than 100,000 tenant farmers. The tenants farm the land in cooperation with the government and the Sudan Gezira Board, which oversees administration, credit, and marketing. Although Sudan’s total output accounts for only a tiny percentage of world production, its importance in the cotton market results from supplying a large part of the extra-long-staple cotton grown in the world.
Sudan has great agricultural potential, but, because of inadequate water sources and transport difficulties, much of its arable land is unused. The Sudanese government tried to tap this potential in the 1970s, when vast projects financed by oil-rich Arab countries were undertaken in an effort to transform Sudan into a major food producer for the Middle East. The resulting capital-intensive projects, including the building of new sugar refineries and a trunk road system, foundered because of poor planning and government inefficiency and corruption. By the early 1980s Sudan found itself saddled with a large foreign debt, declining agricultural production, and little capital left to invest in the country’s traditional irrigated infrastructure and its network of railways, which transported its cotton and other exports. The government has since continued to try to diversify its export-based agriculture with some success, however, encouraging the production of other commodities, such as gum arabic, sesame, and livestock, in an effort to reduce reliance on cotton alone.
Much of the country’s population is engaged in subsistence farming. Many such farmers live in the low-rainfall savannas of southern Sudan, growing crops of sorghum and millet. Many Sudanese households keep some livestock, particularly in rural areas. Donkeys, goats, poultry, cattle, and sheep are the most commonly raised animals. The commercial exploitation of livestock only truly began in the 1970s, and livestock is now an important agricultural export.
Sudan is a leading producer of gum arabic, a water-soluble gum obtained from acacia trees and used in the production of adhesives, candy, and pharmaceuticals. The northern woodlands have been deforested by the extraction of wood for fuel and charcoal.
The Nile rivers are the main source of fish, especially Nile perch. Most of the catch is consumed locally, although attempts have been made to export fish to Europe and the Middle East. Significant quantities of fish and shellfish are produced from the Red Sea.
Oil is a lucrative natural resource. It was first discovered in southwestern Sudan in 1977, and a commercially viable find was made in 1980, but the civil war in the south prevented any exploitation of the oil deposits until the late 20th century. Sudan’s recoverable oil reserves, estimated at 500 million barrels in the early 1990s, were thought to be between five and seven billion barrels in the early 2010s. Upon the secession of the south in 2011, the majority of the oil reserves fell within the borders of newly independent South Sudan.
Sudan has other known mineral deposits, but not all are exploited. They include gold, uranium, chromite, gypsum, mica, marble, and iron ore.
Despite great hydroelectric potential, only a small percentage of Sudan’s electricity is produced by hydroelectric plants. The Sennar Dam on the Blue Nile supplies some electricity to the Gezira Scheme and to Khartoum, and hydroelectric dams have also been built at Khashm Al-Qirbah on the Atbara River, Al-Ruṣayriṣ on the Blue Nile, and Merowe on the Nile. Electricity is largely limited to urban areas and generally is not a common energy source for cooking. Paraffin, gas, charcoal, and firewood are the primary energy sources used to meet either cooking or lighting needs in the country.
