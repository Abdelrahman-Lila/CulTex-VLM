The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM; Arabic: المتحف المصرى الكبير al-Matḥaf al-Maṣriyy al-Kabīr), also known as the Giza Museum, is an archaeological museum in Giza, Egypt, about 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) from the Giza pyramid complex. The Museum hosts over 100,000 artifacts from ancient Egyptian civilization, including the complete Tutankhamun collection, and many pieces will be on display for the first time. With 81,000 m2 (872,000 sq ft) of floor space, it will be the world's largest archeological museum. It is being built as part of a new master plan for the Giza Plateau, known as "Giza 2030".
The GEM will also host permanent exhibition galleries, temporary exhibitions, special exhibitions, children museum, and virtual and large format screens with a total floor area of 32,000 m2.
The museum was built by a joint venture of the Belgian BESIX Group and the Egyptian Orascom Construction.
The original opening was scheduled for 2012, but it was only partially open on 16 October 2024. The Grand Hall, Grand Staircase, commercial area, 12 public galleries and the exterior gardens are open for tours, while the Tutankhamun gallery and Solar Boat Museum are not yet open to the public.  Announced by the Egyptian Authorities, the museum will officially open to the public on 6 July 2025.

Overview
The building design was decided by an architectural competition announced on 7 January 2002. The organisers received 1,557 entries from 82 countries, making it the second largest architectural competition in history. In the second stage of the competition, 20 entries submitted additional information on their designs. Judging was complete by 2 June 2003. The competition was won by architects Róisín Heneghan and Shi-Fu Peng, and their company Heneghan Peng Architects of Ireland; the awarded prize was US$250,000. The building was designed by Heneghan Peng Architects, Buro Happold, Arup and ACE Consulting Engineers (Moharram and Bakhoum). The landscape and site masterplan was designed by West 8; the exhibition masterplan, exhibition design, and museology was led by Atelier Brückner. On 2 February 2010, Hill International announced that Egypt's Ministry of Culture had signed a contract with a joint venture of Hill and EHAF Consulting Engineers to provide project management services during the design and construction of the Grand Egyptian Museum.

The building is shaped like a chamfered triangle in plan. It sits on a site 2 kilometres (1.2 miles) northwest of the pyramids, near a motorway interchange. The building's north and south walls line up directly with the Great Pyramid of Khufu and the Pyramid of Menkaure. The front of the museum includes a large plaza filled with date palms and a façade made of translucent alabaster stone. Inside the main entrance is a large atrium, where large statues will be exhibited.
The project is estimated to cost US$550 million, of which US$300 million will be financed from Japanese loans. The remaining costs are financed by the Supreme Council of Antiquities, other donations, and international funds.
The new museum is designed to include newer technologies, such as virtual reality. The museum will also be an international center of communication between museums, to promote direct contact with other local and international museums. The Grand Egyptian Museum will include a children's museum, conference center, training center, and workshops designed similarly to the old Pharaonic places.

History
On 5 January 2002, then-Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak laid the foundation stone of the Grand Egyptian Museum.
In 2006, the 3,200 years old Statue of Ramesses II was relocated from Ramses Square in Cairo to the Grand Egyptian Museum site, near that Giza Plateau. It was moved to the atrium of the museum in January 2018.
In 2007, GEM secured a $300 million loan from the Japan Bank for International Cooperation. The Egyptian Government will fund $147 million while the remaining $150 million will be funded through donations and international organisations.
In late August 2008, the design team submitted over 5,000 drawings to the Egyptian Ministry of Culture. Following this, the construction tender was announced in October 2008. Earthmoving has begun to excavate the site for the building.
Tendering was due in September 2009, with an estimated completion date of 2013.
On 11 January 2012, a joint venture between Egypt's Orascom Construction (OC) and the Belgian BESIX was awarded the contract for phase three of the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), a deal valued at $810 million.

In January 2018, Besix and Orascom brought in and installed an 82-ton, 3,200-year-old statue of Ramses II in the Grand Egyptian Museum. It was the first artefact to be installed in the Museum, during construction, due to its size.
On 29 April 2018, a fire broke out near the entrance of the GEM but artifacts were not damaged and the cause of the fire was unknown.
In May 2018, the last of King Tutankhamun's chariots was moved to GEM. 
In November 2018, the estimate for a full opening was pushed back to last quarter of 2020, according to Tarek Tawfik, GEM's director. In April 2020, the planned opening of the museum was pushed to 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Various subsequent estimates ranged from 2020 to 2023.
In August 2020, two colossal statues discovered in the sunken city of Thonis-Heracleion by the IEASM were set up in the entrance hall of the GEM.
The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) began limited public access in February 2023, allowing visitors to explore the main entrance hall and commercial areas. In May 2024, Gihane Zaki was appointed as the head of the museum, and it was announced that the official opening was scheduled for "later this year". However, there has been no official announcement of a definitive opening date.
On October 16, 2024, the museum expanded its offerings by opening twelve main galleries as part of a trial run. These galleries showcase artifacts from various periods of ancient Egyptian history, with daily attendance capped at 4,000 visitors. Despite these significant developments, the full official opening—featuring the complete display of the Tutankhamun collection and the solar boats—remains pending.
The GEM is available for private tours in advance of its official opening.

Logo design
On 10 June 2018, the museum's logo was revealed, which will be used in the museum's promotional campaign in Egypt and the world. The logo was designed by Tariq Atrissi. The cost of the design amounted to 800,000 Egyptian pounds, which included the costs of designing the museum exhibition implemented by the German company "Atelier Bruckner".

Exhibits
The exhibits cover about one-third of the total museum's 50-hectare grounds displaying over 13,000 artefacts in 12 galleries arranged by time period (c.3100BCE~400CE) and theme (Society/Kingship/Beliefs) from the museum's total collections of 50,000 objects. The artefacts were relocated from storage and museums in Cairo, Luxor, Minya, Sohag, Assiut, Beni Suef, Fayoum, the Delta, and Alexandria.
As of January 2025, the Grand Egyptian Museum has only partially opened, rather than fully inaugurating as originally planned. The official grand opening was expected to take place in late 2024, with the first exhibition intended to showcase 5,000 objects from King Tutankhamun's tomb—relocated from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo—and the reconstructed (August 2021) Khufu ship, a solar barque, which was transferred from the Giza Solar boat museum beside the Great Pyramid.
At present, the golden mask and primary funerary items of King Tutankhamun have yet to be moved to the new museum, and the Khufu solar ship remains inaccessible to the general public, available only through special private tours that can only be arranged in advance.

Events
The museum has hosted different artistic and cultural events and venues since its partial opening. The first musical concert held in the museum had Egypt's soprano Fatma Said along with United Philharmonic Orchestra & Choir led by Nader Abbassi on 20 January 2023, the concert had a number of foreign ambassadors and public figures from Egypt and abroad, and it received a great reaction from the Egyptian audience, specifically for the song "Masr Heya Ommi" that received more than 2 million view on Said's YouTube Channel with audience commenting on the magnificence of Ramses II Statue next to the musical orchestra.

JICA-GEM Joint Conservation project
# Britannica:
The Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM), located in Giza, Egypt, is the world's
largest archaeological museum, covering 120 acres (50 hectares). It houses
artifacts from Egypt's human civilization, spanning from the predynastic
period to the Greco-Roman era (c. 3100 BCE to 400 CE). The museum's collection
includes items from other Egyptian cultural institutions, most notably the
Egyptian Museum in Cairo, with the treasures of King Tutankhamun's tomb as a
centerpiece.

### History and Design

Plans for the museum were announced in 1992 by President Hosni Mubarak to
consolidate ancient artifacts scattered throughout Egypt. The design contract
was awarded to Heneghan Peng Architects in 2003, with construction beginning
in 2005. Delays due to political unrest and the COVID-19 pandemic interrupted
progress, but private tours began in 2022. Some galleries opened to the public
in October 2024, with the full opening scheduled for July 2025.

The museum's design echoes the Pyramids of Giza, with triangular patterns on
its facade and sloping interior ceilings. The entrance features translucent
alabaster panels framed by hieroglyphs, leading to an atrium with a colossal
statue of Ramses II. Exhibition halls display artifacts divided by period and
themes, with windows offering views of the pyramids. The complex includes
restaurants, conservation labs, gardens, a theater, a conference center, and
commercial space, and is expected to attract millions of visitors annually.

### Collection and Purpose

In the late 2010s, the Egyptian government began transferring tens of
thousands of objects to the GEM, including items from the tomb of Tutankhamun.
The GEM aims to provide leverage for the return of looted cultural heritage,
such as the Rosetta Stone, the bust of Nefertiti, and the Zodiac of Dendera.

Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM),  museum in Giza, Egypt, housing archaeological artifacts from thousands of years of human civilization in Egypt, spanning from the predynastic period to the Greco-Roman era (c. 3100 bce to 400 ce). Its collection draws from a number of cultural institutions in Egypt, including the Egyptian Museum (founded in 1858) in downtown Cairo. The centerpiece of that museum’s collection is the cache of items discovered in the tomb of King Tutankhamun, and it will have pride of place in the new museum. Occupying a 120-acre (50-hectare) plot of land, the Grand Egyptian Museum (GEM) is the largest archaeological museum in the world.
In 1992 Egypt’s president, Hosni Mubarak, announced plans to build a new museum to bring together the ancient artifacts scattered throughout the country. The Egyptian Museum in Cairo in particular had become crowded with objects, was dimly lit, and was susceptible to vibrations from the city’s traffic. The Ministry of Culture chose a location outside Cairo, away from the congestion but near enough to provide easy access for tourists. In 2002 it launched an international design competition and laid the foundation stone.
In 2003 the firm Heneghan Peng Architects, based in Dublin, was awarded the design contract. Construction began in 2005, but the project encountered a number of delays. Political unrest during the Arab Spring in 2011 and the subsequent resignation of President Mubarak halted work for three years. With the help of international funding, the project resumed in 2014 only to be interrupted again, this time by the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Work eventually got underway again, and the first private tours were offered in 2022. The official opening was repeatedly pushed back, and in October 2024 some of the museum’s galleries opened for public admission in advance of a full opening. The date for a full opening is scheduled for July 2025.
The scale of the building, the pattern of triangles on its facade, and the sloping ceilings of the interior echo the Pyramids of Giza, located 1.2 miles (2 km) to the southeast. Guests pass through an entrance covered with translucent alabaster panels and framed by hieroglyphs to reach the shaded atrium, where they are greeted by a 3,200-year-old colossal statue of Ramses II. They can then ascend a grand staircase, flanked with statues of deities and royalty, to reach the massive exhibition halls. The displays are divided by period and by such themes as religion, rulers, and society. Tall glass windows at the southeast end of the building offer unobstructed views of the pyramids. The nearly $1 billion complex also includes eight restaurants, a food court, restoration and conservation labs, outdoor gardens, a 3D movie theater, a conference center, and commercial space. The GEM is expected to attract some five to seven million visitors each year.
While the museum was under construction in the late 2010s, the Egyptian government began transferring tens of thousands of objects from the Egyptian Museum and elsewhere. These included a block statue of Queen Hetepheres, one of the earliest examples of its type; a black granite sculpture of Queen Nefertiti; a statue of King Senusret I; and a four-ton, pink granite sculpture of Amenhotep III, showing him seated next to the god Ra. The solar boat of King Khufu, previously shown near the Great Pyramid, was also moved to the GEM. Items from the tomb of Tutankhamun—namely, his mummy, funerary mask, inner gold sarcophagus, jewels, and throne—are expected to be moved from the Egyptian Museum in Cairo to the GEM before the opening.
Egyptian officials and archaeologists hope that the GEM, with its permanent exhibition and conservation spaces, will provide leverage in their request for the return of the country’s looted cultural heritage. Plundered objects include the Rosetta Stone, which is currently housed in the British Museum, London; the bust of Nefertiti in the Neues Museum, Berlin; and the Zodiac of Dendera in the Louvre, Paris.

## Britannica: Egyptian Museum | Artifacts, Antiquities, History, & Facts | Britannica
Egyptian Museum,  museum of Egyptian antiquities in Cairo, which was founded in the 19th century by the French Egyptologist Auguste Mariette and which housed the world’s most valuable collection of its kind into the 21st century.
The Egyptian Museum was founded in 1858 at Būlāq, moved to Al-Jīzah (Giza), and settled in its present site in downtown Cairo in 1897–1902. The building was designed by the French architect Marcel Dourgnon in Neoclassical style and was the first purpose-built museum in the Middle East and North Africa.
The museum is unique in its presentation of the whole history of Egyptian civilization, especially of antiquities of the Pharaonic and Greco-Roman periods. On the ground floor are a number of large and heavy objects, including colossal figures situated inside the middle atrium. At the peak of its collection, the museum stored more than 100,000 items. Most of the artifacts were never displayed, however, because of the museum’s crowded and small space.
Treasures include reliefs, sarcophagi, papyri, funerary art and the contents of various tombs, jewelry, ornaments of all kinds, and other objects. The Tanis collection—sometimes compared in spectacle to that of Tutankhamun’s tomb, although discovered later and less well known—boasts silver coffins, gold masks, royal sarcophagi, and jewelry. There are granite figures of Queen Hatshepsut, as well as colossal figures of Amenhotep IV (Akhenaton) from Karnak. The museum also houses a small but fine collection of Fayum portraits from Hellenistic and Roman times.
In the late 2010s the Egyptian government began transferring tens of thousands of the museum’s items to the larger Grand Egyptian Museum under construction in nearby Giza, including thousands of pieces from the tomb of Tutankhamun. Other objects moved to the new museum from the museum in Cairo included a block statue of Queen Hetepheres, one of the earliest examples of its type, and a black granite sculpture of Queen Nefertiti. A sculpture of Amenhotep II, showing him as the god Tenen, was also moved.
