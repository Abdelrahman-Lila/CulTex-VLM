The Monastery of Saint Mary El-Sourian is a Coptic Orthodox monastery located in Wadi El Natrun in the Nitrian Desert, Beheira Governorate, Egypt. It is located about 500 meters northwest of the Monastery of Saint Pishoy.
The monastery is dedicated to the Virgin Mary and carries her name. In scholarly references from the nineteenth century it is generally called the convent or monastery of Saint Mary Deipara. It is better known nowadays as the Syriac Monastery or the monastery of the Syriacs (Arabic: Dayr al-Suryān) because it was mainly used by monks of the Syriac Orthodox Church from the 8th to the 14th century.

Etymology, foundation and ancient history
The exact date of the monastery's foundation is unknown. Most sources seem however to agree that its foundation took place in the sixth century AD. The establishment of the monastery is closely connected to the Julianist heresy, which spread in Egypt during the papacy of Pope Timothy III of Alexandria. The Julianists believed in the incorruptibility of Christ's body. This was in contradiction with the teaching of the Orthodox Church, which held that Christ had taken human flesh that prevented him from being ideal and abstract, and therefore corruptible. Yet, in the monasteries of Scetes, a majority of the monks embraced the Julian heresy. In reaction, those who did not follow the heresy obtained permission from the governor Aristomachus to erect new churches and monasteries, so that they could settle apart from the Julianists. These new facilities were often built alongside the old ones, even keeping the same name but adding to it the word Theotokos, thus recognizing the significance of the incarnation, which the Julians seemed to minimize. The Syrian Monastery was therefore established by those monks of the Monastery of Saint Pishoy who rejected the Julian heresy. At the time of its construction, they called it the Monastery of the Holy Virgin Theotokos.
Towards the beginning of the eighth century AD, the monastery was sold to a group of wealthy Syriac merchants from Tikrit, who had settled in Cairo, for 12,000 dinars. These merchants converted the monastery for use by Syrian monks, and rebaptized it Monastery of the Holy Virgin of the Syrians. This could be one of the sources of the monastery's modern name. Yet, it is also possible that the monastery had already been inhabited by Syrian monks since the fourth century AD, which could trace the monastery's name to that period.
The Syrian Monastery, like the rest of the monasteries in Scetes, was subject to fierce attacks by desert Bedouins and Berbers. The fifth of these attacks, which took place in 817 AD, was particularly disastrous to this monastery. The monastery was then rebuilt in 850 AD by two monks, named Matthew and Abraham.
In 927 AD, one of the monastery's monks, known as Moses of Nisibis, traveled to Baghdad to ask the Abbasid caliph Al-Muqtadir to grant tax exemption to the monasteries. Moses then traveled through Syria region and Mesopotamia in search of manuscripts. After three years of traveling, he returned to Egypt, bringing with him 250 Syriac manuscript. This made of the Syrian Monastery a prosperous and important facility, possessing many artistic treasures and a library rich in Syriac texts.
Inside the monastery, there is a large door known as the Door of Prophecies or Gate of Prophecies, that features symbolic diagrams depicting the past and the future of the Christian faith through the eyes of Christian monks of the tenth century.

Medieval history
Based on a census taken by Mawhub ibn Mansur ibn Mufarrig, the co-author of the History of the Patriarchs of Alexandria, the Syrian Monastery had some sixty monks in 1088 AD. It was the third at the time in the Nitrian Desert, after the Monastery of Saint Macarius the Great and the Monastery of Saint John the Dwarf.
In the middle of the twelfth century, the Syrian Monastery witnessed a period of trouble, when no Syrian priest was present.  However, in 2000 an inscription from 1285/1286 was found, "which recorded building or other activities in the Monastery".  This may have reflected an influx of Syrian refugees in the 1250s.  In the fourteenth century, the monastery was decimated by the plague. When a monk named Moses from the Monastery of Mar Gabriel in Tur Abdin visited the monastery in 1413 AD, he found only one remaining Syrian monk.
Towards the end of the fifteenth century, the Patriarch of Antioch visited the Syrian Monastery, granting it many privileges and donations, in order to restore it to its former glory. However, Egyptian monks continued to populate the monastery and, by 1516 AD, only 18 out of 43 monks were Syrian. By the time of Pope Gabriel VII of Alexandria, who himself had been a monk at the Syrian Monastery, it was able to supply ten monks to the Monastery of Saint Paul the Anchorite and twenty to the Monastery of Saint Anthony in the Eastern Desert when those two communities were damaged by Bedouin raids.
In the seventeenth century, western travelers from France, Germany and England visited the monastery and reported that there were two churches, one for the Syrians and one for the Egyptians (Copts). They also mention a miraculous Tree of Saint Ephrem. According to tradition, Saint Ephrem was a fourth-century Syrian theologian and ascetic from Nisibis. He sought to meet the holy monk Saint Pishoy, and thus came to the monastic centers of Scetes. When the two men met, they were unable to communicate because Ephrem spoke only Syriac. Yet, suddenly and miraculously, Saint Pishoy began to express himself in that language, enabling his visitor to understand him. During this exchange, it is said that Saint Ephrem leaned his staff against the door of the hermitage and all at once it became rooted and even sprouted foliage. Near the church of the Holy Virgin, monks will continue to point out even today this tamarind, miraculously born from Ephrem's staff.
When Peter Heyling, a Lutheran missionary from Lübeck, and Yusuf Simaan Assemani, a Lebanese envoy of Pope Clement XI of Rome, visited the Syrian monastery between the mid-seventeenth and mid-eighteenth centuries, they found no Syrian monks living in it. The latter managed to acquire forty precious manuscripts from the monastery's library, which are kept today in the Vatican Library.

Modern history
Between 1839 and 1851, the British Museum in London was able to purchase about five hundred Syriac manuscripts from the monastery's library, concerned not only with religious topics, but also with philosophy and literature. Famous visitors to the monastery during this time included Lansing (1862), Chester (1873), Junkers (1875), Jullien (1881) and Butler (1883).
The manuscripts found in the Syrian monastery inspired intense research on the Syriac language and culture, for until that time, many classical texts from Aristotle, Euclid, Archimedes, Hippocrates and Galen were known to Western scholars only in their thirteenth-century Latin translations. Even these were often translations from earlier Arabic sources. These documents are the oldest copies of important Greek classical texts, with some dating back to the fifth century.
Today, the Syrian monastery provides a great opportunity to study the development of Coptic wall painting. Between 1991 and 1999, several segments of wall paintings layered on top of each other were uncovered in the Church of the Holy Virgin and the Chapel of the Forty-Nine Martyrs, dating from between the seventh and the thirteenth centuries. There is currently an ongoing project to uncover, restore and conserve wall paintings within the monastery.
The monastery is enclosed by a large wall, built towards the end of the ninth century, and whose height varies between 9.5 and 11.5 meters. The monastery also includes a keep (tower) and a refectory. The five churches inside the monastery are named after the Virgin Mary (2 of the churches), the Forty-Nine Martyrs, Saints Honnos and Marutha, and Saint John the Dwarf.

# Britannica:
A Syrian Monastery refers to monastic traditions and communities within Syria
and its neighboring regions. These monasteries have played a significant role
in the religious, cultural, and intellectual history of the Middle East.

### Early Christian Monasticism

Eastern Christian monasticism began in the 3rd and 4th centuries, emphasizing
contemplative life and prayer. It included both solitary (eremitic) and
communal (cenobitic) living, with the latter becoming a model in Byzantium and
influencing Slavic lands. Monks often upheld Christian integrity and were
respected by both the masses and intellectuals.

### Influence on Culture

Syrian monasteries have been centers of learning and played a crucial role in
preserving Greek texts and mediating between ancient Greek learning and the
Islamic world. They have also contributed to the development of Byzantine
religious poetry and music.

### Art and Architecture

In ancient Syria and Palestine, religious buildings, like the one uncovered in
Jericho, showed early attempts at formal architecture. Over time, Syrian
architecture developed unique features, such as wooden-pillared porticoes in
palaces. Additionally, the carving and decoration of ivory, as well as the
repoussé ornament of ceremonial bowls and other bronze objects, demonstrate
the craftsmanship of the region.

### Tension and Tradition

Christianity has had a complex relationship with tradition, sometimes
rejecting old traditions while creating new ones. This tension is evident in
the development and use of religious art, with early Christians initially
resisting images but later developing a unique form of art to express
Christian themes.



## Britannica: Syrian chant | Traditional Vocal Music of the Levant | Britannica
Syrian chant,   generic term for the vocal music of the various Syrian Christian churches, including Eastern Orthodox churches such as the Jacobites and Nestorians, and the Eastern churches in union with Rome—e.g., the Maronites (mostly in Lebanon) and the Chaldeans, who are dissidents from the Nestorians. To these should be added some branches of nearly all of these groupings in the province of Malabār, India.
Knowledge of Syrian liturgical music before the last century is very limited. Inferences may be made about some older principles of musical performance, for Syrian influences on neighbouring peoples were strong; Syrian practices, for example, spread among the Greeks in the Byzantine Empire. Before its conquest by the Muslims (mid-7th century), Syria was one of the earliest and most important Christian lands in the Middle East.
Although the responsorial chanting (alternation between a soloist and a choir) found in Eastern and Western liturgies may have originated in Hebrew temple ritual, it is considered probable that antiphonal singing (alternation between two choirs) is of Syrian origin, and Syrian sources are among the earliest to document its existence. Syrian poetry and poetic forms also influenced the development of Byzantine religious poetry, establishing patterns of poetic forms that were emulated by the Greeks and other groups. Even the Byzantine oktōechos, a theoretical concept of eight modes according to which melodies were classified (see ēchos), is now viewed as an exportation from Syria, where it was known by the 6th century. It is probable that throughout the Middle East there have been similar premises for musical composition and that the basic approach to liturgical music was and is through a small number of melodic formulas. These serve as melodic skeletons, as starting points for improvisation by singers. The concept of the melodic formula is fairly elastic: it is not an unchangeable pattern but rather a theme that is subject to variations in which the basic skeleton is always recognizable, even when numerous melodic additions make immediate recognition difficult. Most of the singers are professional chanters, frequently inheriting their positions from their fathers.
It is thought by some that the subtle tonal and rhythmic intricacies encountered in modern performances of Syrian chant are remnants of a sophisticated musical tradition rooted in the early centuries of Christianity; others view the same traits as elements of Turkish influence imported into Syria in the late European Middle Ages.

## Britannica: Syria - Ottoman Rule, Conflict, Refugees | Britannica
Throughout the 15th century, Mamluk Syria continued to decline, while a new power was growing to the north, that of the Ottoman Turkish sultanate in Asia Minor. Having occupied Constantinople and the Balkans, it began to look southward. In 1516 Sultan Selim I defeated the Mamluks in the Battle of Marj Dābiq and occupied the whole of Syria that year and Egypt the next. Although parts of Syria enjoyed some local autonomy, the area as a whole remained for 400 years an integral section of the Ottoman Empire. It was divided into provinces, each under a governor: Damascus, Aleppo, and later Tripoli and Ṣaydā, or Sidon, of which the administrative center was later moved to Acre. Damascus, the largest, had special importance as the place from which the pilgrimage to Mecca was organized every year. The governor of Damascus led the pilgrimage when possible, and most of the revenues of the province were earmarked for its expenses.
The tax system continued in principle to be that of Muslim law—a land tax, a poll tax on Christians and Jews, and customs duties. But the Ottomans, like their predecessors, gave the right to collect and keep the land tax in return for military service. Later this system was allowed to decay, and tax collection was turned over to tax farmers (mültezim), who became in the course of time nearly a landowning class. The official religious hierarchy of judges, jurisconsults, and preachers served as an intermediary between government and subjects, as did guild masters and the heads of the local mystical orders (Sufis).
Within this framework of law, order, and taxation, the local communities were left to regulate their own lives. In the desert, the Bedouin tribes were controlled to some extent by gifts, the encouragement of factions, and occasional military expeditions but otherwise were not interfered with. The Alawites and the Ismāʿīlīs dwelling in the Al-Anṣariyyah Mountains were watched by the Ottoman governors, but they were not interfered with so long as they paid their taxes. In the Jabal Al-Durūz region, south of Damascus, there grew up an autonomous community of Druze farmers who did not pay taxes to the Ottoman authorities. The authority of the Christian patriarchs over their communities was recognized. In the corps of ʿulamāʾ (learned Muslims holding government appointments) most positions except the highest were held by members of local families having a tradition of religious learning. They continued to be, as under the Mamluks, spokesmen and leaders of the Muslim citizens.
The early Ottoman governors paid much attention to agriculture, and their fiscal system was designed to encourage it. In parts of Syria it flourished during the 16th and 17th centuries, and, apart from cereals for local consumption, cotton and silk were produced for export. Aleppo and Damascus not only were important centers of handicrafts but also served as market towns for the desert and countryside and as stages on the desert routes to the Persian Gulf and Persia. Aleppo also was an important center of trade with Europe; French and English merchants had largely replaced Italian ones, and there grew up also a class of Syrian Christian and Jewish merchants who developed contacts with Egypt, Italy, and France.
Throughout the 17th and 18th centuries the position of the Christians improved. Catholic missions, protected by France, enlarged the Catholic communities of both Latin and Eastern rites, founded schools, and spread knowledge of European languages. Colleges in Rome produced an educated priesthood, and the Christian communities in Aleppo and Lebanon brought forth scholars. Muslim Arab culture of the time produced the theologian ʿAbd al-Ghanī al-Nābulusī, as well as Ibrāhīm al-Ḥalabī, a systematic jurist.
In spite of widespread unrest in the early 17th century, Ottoman rule was in general stable and effective until the end of that century. After that it declined rapidly, in Syria as elsewhere. Control by the central government weakened; the standard of administration sank; and the Janissaries (the elite troops of the sultan) lost their discipline and became a menace to order. The result was a shrinkage of agricultural production, as the villages suffered from the depredations of soldiery and tax collectors and from Bedouin incursions. This was a period of activity in the Syrian desert, and Bedouin tribes, moving northwest from Arabia, extended their control far into the settled land. In the towns there was also a decline. The desert routes were unsafe, and the European merchant colonies were shrinking. But there was still a vigorous commercial life; the standard of craftsmanship was high, and the great tradition of Islamic architecture was continued under the patronage of provincial dignitaries and governors.
Ottoman authority did reassert itself to some extent, but in a new form. For most of the 18th century, Damascus was ruled by governors belonging to the ʿAẓm family, loyal to the sultan but with more independence than earlier sultans would have allowed. They controlled the Janissaries, kept back the Bedouin, maintained security, and sometimes extended their authority to other provinces. In the province of Sidon, power was held on similar terms by a ruthless and able Bosnian governor, Aḥmad al-Jazzār (1775–1804), and his group of Mamluks. Such rulers raised their own armies, but this involved additional taxation and further depressed the condition of the peasants. Agriculture flourished in the hilly districts, which were virtually beyond Ottoman control, free from Bedouin attacks, and overseen by strong local rulers who protected agriculture and made Acre a prosperous center of trade.
At the beginning of the 19th century, Syria had some islands of prosperity: Aleppo and Damascus (each with roughly 100,000 inhabitants), Mount Lebanon, and certain other secluded districts. In general, however, the country was in decay, the small towns subsisting on local trade and the villagers receding in face of the Bedouin. The Ottoman hold on the country was at its weakest. In Damascus and Aleppo the governors were scarcely able to control the population of city or countryside. The prince of Lebanon, Bashīr II (1788–1840), who had been installed by al-Jazzār and remained quiet while al-Jazzār was alive, gradually extended his control over districts beyond Lebanon. In 1810 the Wahhābīs from central Arabia threatened Damascus.
In 1831 the ruler of Egypt, Muḥammad ʿAlī, sent his son Ibrāhīm Pasha at the head of his modern army into Palestine. Helped by Bashīr and other local leaders, Ibrāhīm conquered the country and advanced into Asia Minor. He ruled Syria for almost 10 years. The whole country was controlled from Damascus. There and in the provincial centers the governors were Egyptians, but they were assisted by councils representing the population. In political matters Ibrāhīm relied largely on Bashīr. New taxes were introduced and strictly collected, agriculture was encouraged, and the Bedouin pushed back. After an abortive attempt to introduce trade monopolies, Ibrāhīm encouraged European traders by maintaining better security. The Christian and Jewish populations were treated with consideration.
After a time, Ibrāhīm’s rule became unpopular because his taxes were heavy and because he tried to disarm and conscript the population. The European powers (except France) also objected to Egyptian rule in Syria because it was a threat to the Ottoman Empire, the weakness or disintegration of which might cause a European crisis. In 1839 war broke out between Muḥammad ʿAlī and his suzerain, the sultan. Ibrāhīm defeated the Ottoman army, but in 1840 the European powers intervened. After an ultimatum, a British, Ottoman, and Austrian force landed on the Syrian coast; the British encouraged a local insurrection, and the Egyptians were forced to withdraw from Syria, which reverted to the sultan’s government.

## Britannica: Eastern Orthodoxy - Church Structure, Canon Law, Sacraments | Britannica
The basic structure for the Orthodox church is defined by the New Testament writings; the canons (regulations and decrees) of the first seven ecumenical councils; the canons of several local or provincial councils, whose authority was recognized by the whole church; the so-called Apostolic Canons (actually some regulations of the church in Syria, dating from the 4th century); and the “canons of the Fathers,” or selected extracts from prominent church leaders having canonical importance. The various canons were later compiled in the Byzantine nomocanon, attributed in its final form to the patriarch Photius (9th century). The Byzantine church, as well as the modern Orthodox church, adapted the general principles of this collection to its particular situation.
The canons themselves do not represent a system or a code. They do, however, reflect a consistent view of the church, of its mission, and of its various ministries. They also reflect an evolution of ecclesiastical structure. For the Orthodox church today, only the original self-understanding of the church has a theologically normative value. Thus, those canons that reflect the nature of the church as the body of Christ have an unchanging validity today. Other canons, if they can be recognized as conditioned by the historical situation in which they were issued, are subject to change by conciliar authority, and others have simply fallen out of practice. The use and interpretation of the canons is therefore possible only in the light of some understanding of the church’s nature. This theological dimension is the ultimate criterion through which it is possible to distinguish what is permanent in the canons from that which represents no more than a historical value.
The Orthodox understanding of the church is based on the principle, attested to in the canons and in early Christian tradition, that each local community of Christians, gathered around its bishop and celebrating the Eucharist, is the local realization of the whole body of Christ. “Where Christ is, there is the Catholic church,” wrote St. Ignatius of Antioch (c. 100 ce). Modern Orthodox theology also emphasizes that the office of bishop is the highest among the sacramental ministries and that there is therefore no divinely established authority over that of the bishop in his own community, or diocese. Neither the local churches nor the bishops, however, can or should live in isolation. The wholeness of church life, realized in each local community, is regarded as identical to that of the other local churches in the present and in the past. This identity and continuity is manifested in the act of the ordination of bishops, an act that requires the presence of several other bishops in order to constitute a conciliar act and to witness to the continuity of apostolic succession and tradition.
The bishop is primarily the guardian of the faith and, as such, the centre of the sacramental life of the community. The Orthodox church maintains the doctrine of apostolic succession—i.e., the idea that the ministry of the bishop must be in direct continuity with that of the Apostles of Jesus. Orthodox tradition—as expressed especially in its medieval opposition to the Roman papacy—distinguishes the office of “Apostle” from that of bishop, however, in that the first is viewed as a universal witness to the historical Jesus and his Resurrection while the latter is understood in terms of the pastoral and sacramental responsibility for a local community, or church. The continuity between the two is, therefore, a continuity in faith rather than in function.
No bishop can be consecrated or exercise his ministry without being in unity with his colleagues—i.e., being a member of an episcopal council, or synod. After the Council of Nicaea (325), whose canons are still effective in the Orthodox church, each province of the Roman Empire had its own synod of bishops that acted as a fully independent unit for the consecration of new bishops and also as a high ecclesiastical tribunal. In the contemporary Orthodox church these functions are fulfilled by the synod of each autocephalous church. In the early church the bishop of the provincial capital acted as chairman of the synod and was generally called metropolitan. Today this function is fulfilled by the local primate who is sometimes called patriarch (in the autocephalous churches of Constantinople [Istanbul], Alexandria, Antioch, Jerusalem, Russia, Georgia, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, and Ukraine), but he may also carry the title of archbishop (in Cyprus and Greece) or metropolitan (in Poland, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, and the United States). The titles of archbishop and metropolitan are also widely used as honorific distinctions.
The jurisdiction of each autocephalous synod generally coincides with national borders—with numerous exceptions in the Middle East (e.g., in the jurisdiction of Constantinople over the Greek islands and the jurisdiction of Antioch over several Arab states)—and also concerns the national dioceses of the Orthodox diaspora (e.g., in western Europe, Australia, and the United States), which frequently remain under the authority of their mother churches. The latter situation led to an uncanonical overlapping of Orthodox jurisdictions, all based on ethnic origins. Several factors, originating in the Middle Ages, have contributed to modern ecclesiastical nationalism in the Orthodox church. These factors include the use of the vernacular in the liturgy and the subsequent identification of religion with national culture.
The emphasis on communion and fellowship as the basic principle of church life inhibited the development of clericalism, the tradition of enhancing the power of the church hierarchy. The early Christian practice of lay participation in episcopal elections never disappeared completely in the East. In modern times it has been restored in several churches, including those in the United States. Besides being admitted, at least in some areas, to participation in episcopal elections, Orthodox laymen often occupy positions in church administration and in theological education. In Greece almost all professional theologians are laymen. Laymen also frequently serve as preachers.
The lower orders of the clergy— priests and deacons—are generally married men. The present canonical legislation allows the ordination of married men to the diaconate and the priesthood, provided that they were married only once and that their wives are neither widows nor divorcees. These stipulations reflect the general principle of absolute monogamy, which the Eastern church considered as a Christian norm to which candidates for the priesthood are to comply strictly. Deacons and priests cannot marry after their ordination. Bishops are selected from among the unmarried clergy or widowed priests. The rule defining the requirement for an unmarried episcopate was issued at a time (6th century) when monks represented the elite of the clergy. The contemporary decrease in the number of monks in the Orthodox church has created a serious problem in some territorial churches, as new candidates for the episcopacy are difficult to find.
Eastern Christian monasticism began in the 3rd and 4th centuries of the Christian era. From its beginning it was essentially a contemplative movement seeking the experience of God in a life of permanent prayer. Concern for prayer, as the central and principal function of monasticism, does not mean that the Eastern Christian monastic movement was of a single uniform character. Eremitic (solitary) monasticism, favouring the personal and individual practice of prayer and asceticism, often competed with cenobitic (communal) monastic life, in which prayer was mainly liturgical and corporate. The two forms of monasticism originated in Egypt and coexisted in Byzantium as well as throughout eastern Europe.
In Byzantium the great monastery of Studion became the model of numerous cenobitic communities. It is in the framework of the eremitic, or Hesychast, tradition, however, that the most-noted Byzantine mystical theologians, such as St. Symeon the New Theologian and St. Gregory Palamas, received their training. One of the major characteristics of the Hesychast tradition is the practice of the Jesus prayer, or constant invocation of the name of Jesus, sometimes in connection with breathing. This practice won wide acceptance in medieval and modern Russia. Cenobitic traditions of Byzantium also were important in Slavic lands. The colonization of the Russian north was largely accomplished by monks who acted as pioneers of civilization and as missionaries.
In Byzantium as well as in other areas of the Orthodox world, the monks were often the only upholders of the moral and spiritual integrity of Christianity, and thus they gained the respect of the masses as well as that of the intellectuals. The famous Russian startsy (“elders”) of the 19th century became the spiritual leaders of the great Russian writers Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Nikolay Gogol, and Leo Tolstoy and inspired many philosophers in their quest for religious experience.
Since the 1970s, when a resurgence in the admission of new monks began, the most famous centre of Orthodox monasticism has been Mount Athos in Greece. In this remote location more than 1,000 monks of different national backgrounds are grouped into a monastic republic—a federation of 20 self-governing monasteries and smaller monastic communities whose governor is appointed by the Greek minister of foreign affairs and whose spiritual head is the ecumenical patriarch.

## Britannica: Syro-Palestinian art and architecture | Description, History, & Facts | Britannica
Syro-Palestinian art and architecture,  the art and architecture of ancient Syria and Palestine.
The countries bordering the Mediterranean between the Sinai Peninsula and the Nur Dağları (Amanus Mountains), to which the names Palestine and Syria are often loosely applied, had in fact no geographic integrity or clear historical definition. The interior of Syria and its extension beyond the Euphrates have in the past always been separated ethnographically, and sometimes politically, from the coastal cities of the Levant, the associations of which were with Cilicia and the trade routes of Palestine. In early historical times both Syria and Palestine, however, were continuously dominated by one or other of the great imperial powers—Egyptian, Mesopotamian, or Hittite. This situation was in no way conducive to the coherent development of indigenous culture; consequently, the individual contribution of these countries to the total accomplishment of ancient Middle Eastern art is of secondary importance.
An exception to this generalization must be made where prehistory is concerned, however. An archaeological sounding at Jericho, which carried back the history of settled communities far beyond the earliest finds made in the Tigris valley, uncovered a small, symmetrically planned religious building (dating from approximately 7000 bce); this should perhaps be regarded as the earliest attempt at formal architecture. In a setting only a century or so later, a strange collection of human heads was found, their features competently modeled in plaster, sometimes over the bone of actual skulls.
Early in the 2nd millennium bce, the Levant and its coastal cities became a dependency of Egypt. Local rulers imported Egyptian works of art, which afforded some stimulation to regional craftsmanship. The tombs of the rulers—at Byblos, for instance—were furnished with objects of fine craftsmanship in gold, ivory, ebony, and obsidian. The objects that were made locally can easily be distinguished from those imported from Egypt by the comparative ineptitude of their ornament. Egyptian motifs were generally adopted as elements in decorative design, but they were copied without precision and without regard for their meaning; the results, therefore, were of very uneven quality. The aesthetic failings of partly or wholly derivative ornamental styles characterized Levantine art for many centuries to come.
More obvious signs of regional individuality are apparent in the development of Syrian architecture at this period. It is perhaps best seen in the smaller cities of the interior, which were less subject to Egyptian influence. Two palaces at Alalakh (modern Tell Aƈana, Turkey), in the plain of Antioch, built, respectively, in the 15th and 13th centuries bce, show some characteristically Syrian features. Wooden-pillared porticoes at the entry to reception suites mark the development of a standard palace unit, known as a bit hilani, generally adopted some centuries later by the Syro-Hittites (see art and architecture, Anatolian: Hittite period). Basalt orthostats, as yet unsculptured, anticipated those of the Neo-Assyrian palaces; and mural paintings, like those at Mari, decorated the chambers of an upper story in the Cretan manner. The earlier palace produced a single stone head that illustrates the contemporary Syrian sculpture style at its best. The remaining examples are crude.
During the early centuries of the 1st millennium bce, a strip of the Levant coast, from Ṭarṭūs (Syria) to somewhere south of Mount Carmel, became the homeland of a Canaanite people known as Phoenicians. As a result of archaeological excavations, something is known of their architecture as well as that of the contemporary Israelites in Palestine. Much information has been obtained about their walled cities and the development of their fortifications from the 18th century bce onward. It appears that by the time of King Solomon, in the 10th century bce, such military architecture had been standardized, for at three cities—Hazor, Megiddo, and Gezer—walls and gates alike are almost identical. Walls are of the casemate type (parallel walls with a space between) with internal chambers, and gateways are elaborate, with flanking towers and an approach through several transverse chambers. In the 9th century bce the invention of a more effective battering ram necessitated replacement of casemate walls by more solid structures.
The rather scanty remains of Canaanite temples have also been found at Hazor and elsewhere. They consisted of a courtyard, main hall, and sanctuary, all on a single axis, with occasional side chambers. The Hazor building showed a feature corresponding to the biblical description of the “brazen pillars” on either side of the central doorway of Solomon’s Temple, which had been built by Phoenician craftsmen in the 10th century bce.
Two forms of Phoenician and Syrian craftsmanship take a high place in the repertoire of ancient Middle Eastern art: the carving and decoration of ivory, and the repoussé ornament of ceremonial bowls and other bronze objects. Some of the finest examples in both categories are to be found among the vast assemblage of material imported or appropriated by the Late Assyrian kings and found in their palaces, particularly at Nimrūd. Ivory carving has a long history in Syria and Palestine, as is shown by the well-known ivories from Megiddo, some of which are dated as early as the 14th century bce. So much study has been devoted to their design, especially to its non-Egyptian content and the original contribution of regional craftsmanship, that some scholars think it possible to distinguish purely Syrian designs from those of the Phoenician workshops.

## Britannica: Christianity - Art, Iconography, Religion | Britannica
Christian art constitutes an essential element of the religion. Until the 17th century the history of Western art was largely identical with the history of Western ecclesiastical and religious art. During the early history of the Christian church, however, there was very little Christian art, and the church generally resisted it with all its might. Clement of Alexandria, for example, criticized religious (pagan) art for encouraging people to worship that which is created rather than the Creator. There was also little need for Christian art, because monumental churches had yet to be built and there were few wealthy patrons to commission it. By the late 2nd century an incipient pictorial art had appeared in the Christian church, and by the mid-3rd century art inspired by pagan models as well as Christian themes began to be produced. Pictures began to be used in the churches when Christianity was legalized and supported by the Roman emperor Constantine in the early 4th century, and they soon struck roots in Christian popular religiosity.
A number of factors explain the slow development of Christian art in the early centuries of the church. Christianity received from its Jewish origins a prohibition against the use of images to depict the sacred or holy, including humans, who were created in “the image of God.” The early church was also deeply involved in a struggle against paganism—which, to the Christian observer, was idolatry in that its many gods were represented in various pictorial and statuary forms. In early Christian missionary preaching, the Old Testament attacks upon pagan veneration of images were transferred directly to pagan image veneration of the first three centuries ce. The struggle against images was conducted as a battle against “idols” with all the intensity of faith in the oneness and exclusiveness of the imageless biblical God. The abhorrence of images was strengthened further by the emperor’s cult, which Christians so despised. Christians were compelled to venerate the imperial images by offering sacrifices to them; refusal to make sacrifice was the chief cause of martyrdom. Characteristically, then, the church’s reaction to its public recognition was expressed in the riotous destruction of pagan divine images.
In spite of these very strong religious and emotional restraints, the church developed a form of art peculiar to its needs. From late antiquity to the time of the Counter-Reformation, Western art was essentially the art of the church; both lay and secular patrons commissioned works of art that illustrated important Christian themes and stood as testimony to their own faith. Assuming many forms, Christian art could be found in private homes, churches, and public spaces. Churches, themselves artistic triumphs, were adorned with a broad range of art, including statuary, paintings, and stained glass. Another important form was illumination; illuminated manuscripts were prized possessions and often displayed on high holy days. The attitude reflected in these practices was expressed in the famous dictum of Pope Gregory I, that art is the book of the illiterate; art was thus conceived as having a didactic function.
The starting point for the development of Christian pictorial art lies in the basic teaching of the Christian revelation itself—namely, the incarnation, the point at which the Christian proclamation is differentiated from Judaism. The incarnation of the Son of Man, the Messiah, in the form of a human being—who was created in the “image of God”—granted theological approval of a sort to the use of images that symbolized Christian truths. Clement of Alexandria, at one point, called God “the Great Artist,” who formed humans according to the image of the Logos, the archetypal light of light. The great theological struggles over the use of images within the church, particularly in the Byzantine Empire, during the period of the so-called Iconoclastic Controversy in the 8th and 9th centuries indicate how a new understanding of images emerged on the basis of Christian doctrine. This new understanding was developed into a theology of icons that still prevails in the Eastern Orthodox Church in the 21st century.
The great significance of images of the saints for the Orthodox faithful is primarily expressed in the cultic veneration of the images within the worship service. Second, it is expressed in the dogmatic fixation of the figures, gestures, and colours in Eastern church iconic art. In the West, the creative achievement of the individual artist is admired, but Orthodox painting dispenses with the predominance of the individual painter’s freely creative imagination. Throughout the centuries the Eastern church has been content with reproducing certain types of holy images, and only seldom does an individual artist play a predominant role within the history of Orthodox Church painting. Most Orthodox ecclesiastical artists have remained anonymous. Icon painting is viewed as a holy skill that is practiced in cloisters in which definite schools of painting have developed. In the schools, traditional principles prevail so much that different artist-monks generally perform only certain functions in the production of a single icon. Style motifs—e.g., composition, impartation of colour, hair and beard fashions, and gestures of the figures—are fixed in painting books that contain the canons of the different monastic schools of icon painters.
The significance of the image of the saint in the theology, piety, and liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church can be judged historically from the fact that the struggle over holy images within Orthodox Church history brought about a movement whose scope and meaning can be compared only with the Reformation of Luther and Calvin. In the 7th century a tendency hostile to images and fostered by both theological and political figures gained ground within the Byzantine Church and upset Orthodox Christendom to its very depths; known as the Iconoclastic Controversy, it was supported by some reform-minded emperors. Although opponents of icons had all the political means of power at their disposal, they were not able to succeed in overthrowing the use of icons. The conclusion of this struggle with the victory of the supporters of the use of icons is celebrated in the entire Orthodox Church on the first Sunday of Lent as the Feast of Orthodoxy.
Orthodox icon painting is not to be separated from its ecclesiastical and liturgical function. The painting of the image is, in fact, a liturgical act in which the artist-monks prepare themselves by fasting, doing penance, and consecrating the materials necessary for the painting. Before the finished icon is used, it likewise is consecrated. Not viewed as a human work, an icon (according to 8th- and 9th-century literature) was understood instead as a manifestation of a heavenly archetype. A golden background is used on icons to indicate a heavenly perspective. The icon is always painted two-dimensionally because it is viewed as a window through which worshipers can view the heavenly archetype from their earthly position. A figure in the three-dimensionality of the plastic arts, such as sculpture, would thus be an abandonment of the character of epiphany (appearance).
Ideas of the iconic liturgy dominate the manuals of the Orthodox icon painters. The model of the Christ figure for icon painters was found in an apocryphal writing of the early church—the Letter of Lentulus, supposedly written by a certain Lentulus, who was named consul in the 12th year of the emperor Tiberius. As the superior of Pontius Pilate, the procurator of Judaea, he by chance was staying in Palestine at the time of the trial of Jesus. In an official report to the emperor about the trial of Jesus, Lentulus included an official warrant for Jesus with a description of the Christ. This apocryphal description furnished the basic model for the Byzantine Christ type.
The Trinity also may not be represented, except in those forms in which, according to the view of Orthodox church doctrine, the Trinity showed itself in the divine Word of the Old and New Testaments. Early church theology interpreted an Old Testament passage (Genesis 18:1 ff.) as an appearance of the divine Trinity—namely, the visit of the three men with the patriarch Abraham at Mamre in Palestine. Also included in icons of the Trinity are the appearance of the three divine persons—symbolized as a hand, a man, and a dove—at the baptism of Jesus (Matthew 3:16 ff.) and the Pentecostal scene, in which the Lord, ascended to heaven, sits at the right hand of God and the Comforter (the Holy Spirit) is sent down to the Apostles in the form of fiery tongues (Acts 2). Another Trinitarian iconic scene is the Transfiguration of Jesus at Mount Tabor (Matthew 17:2).
Icons of Mary were probably first created because of the development of Marian doctrines in the 3rd and 4th centuries. The lack of New Testament descriptions of Mary was compensated by numerous legends of Mary that concerned themselves especially with wondrous appearances of miraculous icons of the mother of God. In Russian and many other Orthodox churches, including the monasteries at Mount Athos, such miraculous mother of God icons, “not made by hands,” have been placed where the appearances of the mother of God took place.
The consecration liturgy of the icons of saints expresses the fact that the saints themselves, for their part, are viewed as likenesses of Christ. In them, the image of God has been renewed again through the working of salvation of the incarnate Son of God.

## Britannica: Syriac literature | Ancient Christian Texts & Poetry | Britannica
Syriac literature,  body of writings in Syriac, an eastern Aramaic Semitic language originally spoken in and around Edessa, Osroëne (modern Şalıurfa, in southeastern Turkey). First attested in the 1st century ad, Syriac spread through the Middle East because of Edessa’s position as the intellectual capital of the Christian Orient. Syriac reached its height just prior to the Arab conquest in the 7th century, after which it gradually declined until it was completely superseded by Arabic in the 14th century. Apart from its obvious interest to Semitic scholars, Syriac literature is of importance for the study of Syrian Christianity, for its preservation of Greek Christian texts, and for its role as an intermediary between ancient Greek learning and the Islamic world. Syriac was the language of an extensive literature, including translations of the Bible, hymns and poems, translations of Greek works, biblical commentaries, historical works, laws, compilations of lives of saints, and works about philosophy, grammar, medicine, and science.
The works of St. Ephraem Syrus (4th century) stood at the beginning of Syrian literature and were never surpassed by any later author. The elegance of his poetry and the beauty of his style earned him the epithet “Harp of the Holy Spirit.” He employed two poetic forms, one for spoken speech in metrical form, whether a narrative or didactic epic, the other a more artful composition in strophes to be sung by a choir or double choir. The most notable Syriac poet after the split between eastern and western Syrian Christianity was Narsai (d. c. 503), a Nestorian Christian. Among the many historical writings in Syriac is the monumental chronicle in 21 books of the patriarch Michael I. The work covers both church and secular history up until 1195 and is valuable because it incorporates many historical sources and forms a veritable depository of lost documents. The last major Syriac writer was Bar Hebraeus (1226–86), a Jewish convert to Syrian Christianity. He wrote extensively in nearly every area of Syriac literature, including grammar, biblical commentary, and science.
A large portion of extant Syrian literature consists of translations of Greek Christian writings—almost all important Christian authors and documents written in Greek were translated by Syrians. This mass of Greco-Syrian translated literature is an essential source for works of Greek Christian literature that have not survived in their original language. Many secular works also were translated into Syriac, including most of the works of Aristotle and other ancient Greek philosophers, as well as the writings of the chief medical and scientific authors of ancient Greece. These translations were critical to the rise of Islamic civilization, since most Greek works were translated from Syriac into Arabic rather than directly from Greek. For instance, to take the works of Galen alone, 130 were translated into Arabic from Syriac but only 9 directly from Greek originals. It was through the medium of Syriac that many works of Greek learning exerted their influence on the Islamic world.

## Britannica: Syrian Catholic Church | Middle East, Christianity, Maronite | Britannica
Syrian Catholic Church,  an Eastern Catholic church of the Antiochene rite, in communion with Rome since the 17th century. In the 5th century, the Christians of Syria largely repudiated the rulings of the Council of Chalcedon (451), which had interpreted the Christological position of the Syrians as well as that of many other Asian and African churches as a monophysite heresy. Attempts at unification with Rome were made, without success, in 1237 and 1247. With the establishment of the Capuchins and Jesuits in Aleppo in 1626, however, conversions to Catholicism followed, and Andrew Akhidjan, a Syrian Catholic priest, was elected bishop of Aleppo (1656) and then patriarch of all Syrians (1662). Because of hostile relations with the non-Chalcedonian Christians, however, a consistent succession of Catholic bishops was not established until 1782, with the election of Michael Jarweh as bishop of Aleppo. The patriarchs resided successively in Dayr al-Zafaran, Sharfeh, Aleppo, Mardin (in Turkey), and finally Beirut. There are patriarchal vicariates or exarchies in Lebanon, Turkey, Jordan, and Egypt, five archdioceses (Aleppo, Baghdad, Damascus, Homs, and Mosul), and one diocese (Hassakeh). Catholic Syrians observe the Liturgy of St. James in Syriac, though certain readings are in Arabic, the language spoken by the faithful.
