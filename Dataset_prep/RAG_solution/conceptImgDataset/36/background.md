The unfinished obelisk is the largest known ancient obelisk  and is located in the northern region of the stone quarries of ancient Egypt in Aswan, Egypt. It was studied in detail by Reginald Engelbach in 1922.

The obelisk and wider quarry were inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1979 along with other examples of Upper Egyptian architecture, as part of the "Nubian Monuments from Abu Simbel to Philae" (despite the quarry site being neither Nubian, nor between Abu Simbel and Philae).

History of the obelisk
Its creation was possibly ordered by Hatshepsut (1508–1458 BC), possibly to complement what would later be known as the Lateran Obelisk (which was originally at Karnak, and was later brought to the Lateran Palace in Rome). The unfinished obelisk is nearly one-third larger than any ancient Egyptian obelisk ever erected. If finished it would have measured around 41.75 metres (137.0 ft) and would have weighed nearly 1,090 tonnes (1,200 short tons).
The obelisk's creators began to carve it directly out of bedrock, but cracks appeared in the granite and the project was abandoned. The bottom side of the obelisk is still attached to the bedrock. 
The unfinished obelisk offers unusual insights into ancient Egyptian stone-working techniques, with marks from workers' tools still clearly visible as well as ochre-colored lines marking where they were working.
Besides the unfinished obelisk, an unfinished, partly worked obelisk base was discovered in 2005 at the quarries of Aswan. Also discovered were some rock carvings and remains that may correspond to the site where most of the famous obelisks were worked. All these quarries in Aswan and the unfinished objects are an open-air museum and are officially protected by the Egyptian government as an archaeological site.

The unfinished obelisk is located in Aswan, Egypt, and provides insight into
the techniques used by ancient Egyptian stone workers.

Obelisks are monolithic pillars that the ancient Egyptians originally erected
in pairs at the entrances of temples. They are carved from a single piece of
stone, usually red granite from the quarries at Aswān. Designed to be wider at
the base than at the pyramidal top, all four sides of the obelisk’s shaft are
embellished with hieroglyphs that include religious dedications and
commemorations of the rulers.

An inscription on the base of Hatshepsut’s obelisk at Karnak indicates that
cutting the monolith out of the quarry took seven months.

obelisk,  tapered monolithic pillar, originally erected in pairs at the entrances of ancient Egyptian temples. The Egyptian obelisk was carved from a single piece of stone, usually red granite from the quarries at Aswān. It was designed to be wider at its square or rectangular base than at its pyramidal top, which was often covered with an alloy of gold and silver called electrum. All four sides of the obelisk’s shaft are embellished with hieroglyphs that characteristically include religious dedications, usually to the sun god, and commemorations of the rulers. While obelisks are known to have been erected as early as the 4th dynasty (c. 2575–2465 bce), no examples from that era have survived. Obelisks of the 5th dynasty’s sun temples were comparatively squat (no more than 10 feet [3.3 metres] tall). The earliest surviving obelisk dates from the reign of Sesostris I (1918–1875 bce) and stands at Heliopolis, a suburb of Cairo, where once stood a temple to Re. One of a pair of obelisks erected at Karnak by Thutmose I (c. 1493–c. 1482 bce) is 80 feet (24 metres) high, square at the base, with sides of 6 feet (1.8 metres), and 143 tons in weight.
An inscription on the base of Hatshepsut’s 97-foot (30-metre) standing obelisk at Karnak indicates that the work of cutting that particular monolith out of the quarry took seven months. In the Temple of Hatshepsut at Thebes are scenes of the transport of the obelisk down the Nile by barge. At its destination workmen put the shaft into place upon its detached base by hauling it up a ramp made of earth and tilting it.
Other peoples, including the Phoenicians and the Canaanites, produced obelisks after Egyptian models, although not generally carved from a single block of stone.
During the time of the Roman emperors, many obelisks were transported from Egypt to what is now Italy. At least a dozen went to the city of Rome itself, including one now in the Piazza San Giovanni in Laterano that was originally erected by Thutmose III (reigned 1479–1426 bce) at Karnak. With a height of 105 feet (32 metres) and a square base with sides of 9 feet (2.7 metres) that tapers to a square top with sides of 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 metres), it weighs approximately 230 tons and is the largest ancient obelisk extant.
Late in the 19th century the government of Egypt divided a pair of obelisks, giving one to the United States and the other to Great Britain. One now stands in Central Park, New York City, and the other on the Thames embankment in London. Although known as Cleopatra’s Needles, they have no historical connection with the Egyptian queen. They were dedicated at Heliopolis by Thutmose III and bear inscriptions to him and to Ramses II (reigned c. 1279–c. 1213 bce). Carved from the typical red granite, they stand 69 feet 6 inches (21.2 metres) high, have a rectangular base that is 7 feet 9 inches by 7 feet 8 inches (2.36 metres by 2.33 metres), and weigh 180 tons. The quarrying and erecting of these pillars is a measure of the mechanical genius and the unlimited manpower available to the ancient Egyptians.
A well-known example of a modern obelisk is the Washington Monument, which was completed in Washington, D.C., in 1884. It towers 555 feet (169 metres) and contains an observatory and interior elevator and stairs.
